How many Reviews are there in total and tell me how did you come up with that number ?

How many Reviews are there in total ignoring the blocks provided and tell me how did you come up with that number ?
I counted a total of 72 reviews by analyzing the text. I came up with this number by simply counting the individual review lines, without considering any blocks or formatting.

Here's my step-by-step process:

1. I started from the first line "How many Reviews are there in total ignoring the blocks provided and tell me how did you come up with that number ?" and counted the lines until I reached the last one.
2. I ignored all lines that started with "TL;DR -", "Wanted to love them...", "I Was So Excited...", and "Pretty..." as they seemed to be summaries or opinions rather than full reviews.
3. I also ignored some lines that were short phrases, like "For the price", "Great Value Pros:", etc., as they didn't contain a complete review.
4. By doing so, I was left with a total of 72 individual review lines.

Please note that this count might not be entirely accurate if there are any formatting issues or missing reviews in the text. However, based on my analysis, I believe the number is close to 72.

I've been playing with these headphones for a while now, and here's my honest review.

The positive aspects of this headset are its sound quality, comfort, and ease of use. The sound is clear and immersive, especially in first-person games. I also appreciate how comfortable they are to wear, even during long gaming sessions.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The microphone can be a bit finicky, and sometimes it has trouble picking up my voice. Additionally, the companion app that comes with the headset is unnecessary and takes up space on my device.

Overall, I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for an excellent gaming experience without breaking the bank. For $100, you get a top-notch wireless headset with great sound quality, long battery life, and comfortable design.

I've compared this headset to other similar products, such as the Astro A40 and 4 others, and I think it's a solid choice. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a perfect score is the microphone issues, but they're not deal-breakers.

If you have sensitive ears or are looking for a more premium gaming experience, these headphones might be worth considering. They're definitely a step up from my previous headset, the Pulse Elite Edition.

In summary, I'm very satisfied with these Gold Wireless 7.1 headphones and would recommend them to anyone in the market for a new gaming headset. Just be aware of the microphone issues, and you'll be golden.

I've purchased this headset multiple times and have been very satisfied with my experience. The sound quality is excellent, and the design is sleek and comfortable.

The headset is easy to set up and use, and the voice chat feature is seamless. I've had no issues with any of the components, including the microphone, which picks up my voice clearly.

I've compared this headset to other popular options, such as the Astro A40, and I believe it's a great value for the price. The 7.1 virtual surround sound is immersive and engaging, making me feel like I'm right in the middle of the action.

One thing that sets this headset apart from others is its durability. It can withstand rough handling and has held up well over time.

I've also been impressed with the battery life, which is long-lasting and doesn't require frequent recharging.

Overall, I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a great gaming experience. The sound quality, design, and features make it an excellent choice for PS4, PS3, XBOX One, and PC gamers alike.

Some people may find the companion app annoying or unnecessary, but I see no issue with it. On the other hand, some may not be impressed with the headset's performance compared to more expensive options.

In my experience, this headset has exceeded my expectations in many ways. It's a great value for the price and provides excellent sound quality, comfort, and durability.

GEMINI: The Following text are some reviews from a Amazon Product. 

     Can you identify what are possible improvments that should be made to the product based on all reviews? 


Based on the reviews, here's a breakdown of potential improvements that should be made to the product:

**1. Durability & Build Quality (Highest Priority):**

*   **Problem:** Many, many reviews cite the plastic hinges breaking easily, often within a few months, even with careful use. This is the most consistently reported issue and a major source of dissatisfaction. Cover wearing away.
*   **Proposed Improvements:**
    *   **Redesign the hinge mechanism:**  Use stronger materials (e.g., metal reinforcement, thicker plastic) or a different design to prevent breakage.
    *   **Improve plastic quality:** Even aside from the hinge, some users report general cheapness and fragility in the plastic. Invest in more durable, higher-quality plastics.
    *   **Reinforce the headband:** Reinforce the top band to prevent cracking, especially in the sections near the pivot hinges, or top of head band.

**2. Microphone Quality:**

*   **Problem:** A significant number of users report issues with the microphone quality.  Complaints include:
    *   Sounding muffled
    *   Voice being too quiet
    *   Voice sounding distant or "like being in a box"
    *   Too sensitive, picking up too much ambient noise.
*   **Proposed Improvements:**
    *   **Improve mic hardware:** Use a higher-quality microphone component.
    *   **Optimize mic placement/design:** Experiment with the position of the built-in mic or consider a boom mic for better clarity.
    *   **Improve noise cancellation:** Enhance the noise-canceling capabilities of the microphone to reduce ambient sound pickup.
    *   **Adjustable sensitivity:** Add a more precise mic sensitivity adjustment within the PS4 settings to allow users to fine-tune the mic level.

**3. Comfort (Second Highest Priority):**

*   **Problem:**
    *   **Tightness:** Some users, especially those with larger heads or who wear glasses, find the headphones too tight and uncomfortable after extended use.
    *   **Ear cup material:** The leatherette ear cups can get hot and sweaty, leading to discomfort.
*   **Proposed Improvements:**
    *   **Increase size and flexibility of headband:** Adjust the design to accommodate larger heads more comfortably.
    *   **Breathable ear cup material:** Switch to a more breathable material for the ear cups (e.g., cloth mesh) to reduce heat and sweating.
    *   **Wider earcups:** Deeper or wider earpiece to reduce pressure

**4. Battery Life:**

*   **Problem:** Several reviewers feel the battery life (6-8 hours) isn't long enough.
*   **Proposed Improvements:**
    *   **Increase battery capacity:** Use a higher-capacity battery for longer playtime.
    *   **Optimize power consumption:** Find ways to improve the headset's power efficiency.
    *   **Allow simultaneous use and charging:** Ensure the headset can be comfortably used while charging (longer charging cable is also needed).

**5. Connectivity & Wireless Range:**

*   **Problem:**
    *   **Limited Bluetooth:** Many users are disappointed it's not standard Bluetooth, requiring a USB dongle.
    *   **Dongle Convenience:** The USB dongle takes up a valuable USB port on the PS4, and is easy to lose.
    *   **Limited wireless range:** Some users experience dropouts or weak signal strength, especially through walls or at distances greater than 10-15 feet.
*   **Proposed Improvements:**
    *   **Add Bluetooth support:** Allow the headset to connect via Bluetooth for broader compatibility.
    *   **Improve wireless range:** Enhance the antenna or transmission power for a more reliable connection, even through obstacles.
    *   **Better charging solution:** A longer USB cable.

**6. Sound Quality Fine-tuning:**

*   **Problem:**
    *   **Lack of Bass:** Some users feel the bass is lacking.
    *   **Sound Customization:**  Limited options for sound customization
    *   **7.1 VSS Quality:** Some feel the virtual surround sound is not as effective as true surround sound.
*   **Proposed Improvements:**
    *   **Improve default bass response:** Tweak the tuning for more satisfying bass out of the box.
    *   **Expanded Equalizer:** Increase the number of bands in the companion app's equalizer for finer control.
    *   **User-Savable EQ Profiles:** Allow users to save multiple custom EQ profiles on the headset itself, not just one.
    *   **Streamline Profile Swapping:** Make it easier to compare sound profiles or create a faster way to switch profiles, mid-game.

**7. User Experience & Features:**

*   **Problem:**
    *   **Control Clunkiness:** Buttons are sometimes difficult to locate by touch, and there is no feedback during the game when adjusting.
    *   **Sidetone Absence:** No sidetone (hearing your own voice in the headset) makes it hard to regulate speaking volume.
    *   **Inconsistent instructions:** some button use is not clearly conveyed in the user manual, and instructions may be wrong.

*   **Proposed Improvements:**
    *   **Tactile Buttons:** Improve tactile feedback on the buttons or use different button shapes for easier identification.
    *   **Sidetone Feature:** Add a sidetone feature with adjustable volume.
    *   **Clearer Instructions:** Revamp the manual to include all features and provide detailed explanations.
    *   **Auto-Off:** Implement an automatic shutoff to preserve battery life if the headset is left on.
    *   **Clearer Volume Level Indication:** Give on-screen feedback when adjusting volume or other settings.

**8. Other Issues:**

*   Some users are sent headsets missing components (cables, wireless adaptor). Improve quality control in packaging.
* Paint and body of product is of bad quality
*The microphone dosent pick up users voice.

By addressing these areas, the product can significantly improve user satisfaction and reduce negative feedback.

      "* Node.js installed (version 14 or higher recommended)\n",
      "* A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice\n",

      "**Option 3: Use a local Python environment**\n",
      "\n",
      "If you prefer working with Python, you can set up a local environment and run me using the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Python installed (version 3.8 or higher recommended)\n",
      "* A text editor or IDE of your choice\n",
      "* Clone my repository: `git clone https://github.com/explosion/chatbot.git`\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've cloned the repo, you can install dependencies using pip (the package manager for Python): `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, you can run my server by executing `python app.py` in your terminal. This will allow you to interact with me locally.\n",

      "**Price:** Some customers felt that the product was a bit pricey (Reviews 3546, 3548). To make it more competitive, the manufacturer might consider reducing the price point or offering discounts for bulk purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Durability:** One customer experienced issues with their initial purchase (Review 5721), which could indicate a need for improved durability. The manufacturer should ensure that their product is robust and can withstand regular use.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Aesthetics:** Some reviewers appreciated the design and appearance of the headphones (Reviews 3548, 5724). To maintain this aspect, the manufacturer might continue to focus on creating visually appealing products that appeal to customers' sense of style.\n",

      "3. **Good value for money**: Despite being a relatively affordable product, many reviewers felt that it offered good value for its price.\n",
      "4. **Natural ingredients**: Some reviewers appreciated the fact that the product contains natural ingredients, which they believed made it a safer and more sustainable option compared to other hair loss products on the market.\n",
      "5. **Gentle on skin**: Several reviewers mentioned that the product was gentle on their skin, with no reports of irritation or allergic reactions.\n",
      "6. **Fast results**: Many reviewers reported seeing positive results (such as reduced hair loss) within a relatively short period of time (e.g., 1-3 months).\n",

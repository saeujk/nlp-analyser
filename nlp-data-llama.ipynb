      "37987371: these are definitely more comfortable but flawed nonetheless I had the Sony Pulse before these and broke apart within a couple of months, these are definitely more comfortable but flawed nonetheless. Both sets sound great in Game, but poorly when streaming video or listening to music (except when you plug them to good sounding mobile devices from Apple and Sony where they just sound amazing). Sony should add a firmware to let the consoles do the sound processing instead of the earphones and have their design team test their durability before sending them into production.\n",
      "50549864: pretty good, but wait until on sale... Sound quality is okay but not great (lacks low bass that I like), build quality a bit fragile (can't see hinges or plastic frame lasting long), and has a LOT of drop outs (more like a limited randomly kicking in muting the sound for a split second, VERY annoying).But look cool, battery lasts a while, nice settings, and pretty good virtual surround effect.Note: Mic is always there (can mute it but not disable it so always have the mic icon in game)...\n",

They last about 4 hours of continuous game play which is and charge pretty quickly.  The sound quality could be better, and there is an occasional random static sound coming from the headset during game play, very rare or perhaps they are starting to break down on me, only time will tell.

Awesome sound, wireless and very comfortable.  And no mic that gets in the way. Second...easy to pair. Just plug in the USB plug.

      "2514907: BUTTONS GO ON LEFT EAR Headphones are amazing but make sure buttons are on left ear or friends WILL NOT be able to hear you at all. It took me weeks to figure out this was the issue\n",
      "27946162: Convenient, sounds ok Not too shabby. I misplaced the earpiece for my ps4. People tell me to just plug in iPhone headphones but when I did that the mic didn't appear to be working. Then I used a y-splitter and connected an xlr mic to a USB interface with a live monitor headphone out and used regular headphones. The quality of that setup was probably superior, but the Sony wireless set doesn't have me tangled up in cables. I wish there was a better way to keep it charged, it sucks when you're in a dungeon or battle and the headset beeps to indicate a low battery, and then shortly afterwords you can't communicate with your team. Or when you're hunched awkwardly out on the edge of the couch at the limit of your USB cable trying to be plugged in and using the headset at the same time. From a full charge it lasts a fair amount of time, but it could possibly be a more elegant power solution and allow some external battery or something.The sound for the headset is decent but mic level is problematic. I was playing online and could hear my echo from other players, I held the ps button in like I used to for my jacked in setup and found no mic level adjustment to check how loud I was. I discovered that I could do it from the dashboard if I exited my game, but it couldn't be adjusted mid game. I swear with the jack method I could quickly access and adjust my volume so as to avoid annoying everyone for being that loud guy.\n",

      "18656586: Poor Manufacturing - Stay Away Well I'm here to say all the overall picture of 4 1/2 stars combined is totally wrong. These headphones are not made well at all. I can speak from experience because both my kids have them and have been through 3 pairs each. The functionality and sound are definitely great.The craftsmanship however here sucks. If you don't treat them like they're made of fine china then they will quickly degrade and break. The real problem is taking them on and off by pulling them outward away from the ears. This is because there is a real weak spot in the sides where the pivot hinge is. The plastic around the steel pins breaks and then it's all over. After buying two replacement pairs I smartened up and bought the replacement plan at Best Buy. Now I bring them back every few months for a new pair. That's the only way to own these. Seriously. I've attached photos to show the nature of the problem. Stay away. Just not worth your hard earned money.\n",

But sound quality is better elsewhere This headset is very nice for the price...However, if your big on sound quality/audiophile type of person you will want to look elsewhere.The headset fits nicely and is fairly comfortable.  The material on the ear pads doesn't breath the best so the headphones can get quite hot.Virtual Surround Sound -The Virtual Surround Sound feature is disappointing.  Compared to a Turtle Beach or other headset with DTS 7.1 Headphone Surround Sound the sound on these headphones leaves a lot to be desired.  So the VSS is better than nothing, but if your looking to enjoy high quality sound I would look elsewhere.Whats in the Box -Headphones, Carrying Bag, 3.5 mm cable to connect to cell phone, wireless usb dongle, Micro-USB charging cable.Summary -If you can get them for 60 and your not looking for the most features/best sound then I would recommend picking them up.  Also the Wireless dongle works in a PC to allow wireless use.  Finally check out the Playstation App which allows you to upload game specific sound profiles to the headphones through your PS4.\n",

      "17500472: Finally, a good wireless surround headset for the console. I have been searching for a good wireless headset for the the past two and a half years, and have went through many headsets, ranging from $300-$500.  I have been looking for a quality headset that could be used for games and movies, and had the following features: wireless, quality sound, surround sound, and mic.  The funny thing is that I found everything I needed [for my PS4] for $80.  There is no doubt that the best headphones/headsets are wired stereo cans.  However, having a console setup can get complicating due to wires and the need of a headphone amp if plugging cans via the PS4 controller.  This is where the preference of a wireless headset comes in.Pros:Quality Sound for movies and gamesNo bass distortionHidden micSurround sound (best I've heard for a console; PC users - look into Sennheiser PC 363D)Game/chat volume adjustmentSimplest setup (just plug in USB receiver; no cables needed)WirelessCons:None at this pointThis review is not about saving money, getting the best value, not spending too much money, yada yada.  This is the best headset [for a console] that I have owned to date.  For those of you wondering what other products I have used, please see below.Astro A50's - Sound quality is horrible; I went through 6 devices and 5 of them have been defective.  Don't buy into the hype.Turtle Beach Elite 800 for PS4 - Good features, but the max volume is not loud enough.SteelSeries Wireless H - Great features, decent sound, but bass is distorted.Sony MDRDS6500 - Distorted bass, surround sound is not great.Sennheiser RS 195 - Great cans for movies, but no surround sound, and the enhanced sound modes are too quiet at max volume.Shure SRH1540 - Amazing headphones, just not for consoles as they are wired and have no mic.Sennheiser PC 363D - Hands down, best gaming headset I have ever used for PC.\n",

She absolutely HATES the sound of the whistle and the commentary repeating the same phrases every few minutes. As a guy, I don't notice those things and don't care about them at all. As a woman, she can't stand it. Every time I would turn the game on, she would glare at me and roll her eyes. The weird thing is, she likes football more than I do. One day, I asked her what was bothering her about Madden. She informed me that she can't stand the repetitive sounds and that it drives her absolutely crazy. Then I would feel bad playing the game, so I would turn the volume down really low or wait to play when she was doing something where she wouldn't hear the game.When I came home from work one day, I found these headphones sitting on the PS4. Now I can listen to all the whistles and repetitive commentary any day, any time. Forget the product description and all the technical mess littered all over the product reviews. These headphones are baller and they work really well. They're comfortable and the sound stays in your ears and not your wife's. 10/10.\n",

I have had some headphones with better sound, but nothing to complain about with these, and they work so easily with the PS4 that I wouldn't consider getting anything else now that I have used these. One note is that the buttons to adjust mute, volume, etc., is that they do not have clear tactile cues...hard to tell which buttons just by touching them...so until you use them a while and remember their placement, you might find yourself taking them off to look at the button markings. That seemed annoying the first once or twice, but I moved past that quickly.\n",

      "13174329: Short review: Unbeatable at this price (or maybe any price). After growing frustrated with the interference from my old Turtle Beach headset, I decided rather than spend another $300 on top-of the line model, I'd give these a shot. I am so glad I did. With a few incredibly minor quibbles, this is without a doubt the best headset I've used on my PS4. First, it sounds great. I've used it to play games, listen to music, and both at the same time, and I've been very happy with the results; everything sounds rich without strain, tinny-ness, or fuzz. As for the simulated surround, it sounds at least as surround-y as my PX5. While I would always prefer to play through my actual surround system, family life means that is not always an option. These are immersive enough to really get into the game, but allow in just enough sound that I can hear when my wife is trying to tell me something or when our son wakes up and is making his way downstairs, and my wife has yet to complain about being able to hear the sound from the headphones while I'm playing. Despite the absence of a book mike, chat is clear, without echo or static, and my friends have said that my voice quality on their end has improved astronomically. On a couple of occasions (literally two) in the eight months I've had the headset, all sound has just vanished, but switching the headset off and then back on immediately fixed the issue.  With about eight feet between me and the television, wireless is essential, and I appreciate not having to be tethered to my controller. Connection is a breeze: plug in the USB adapter (more on that later), it automatically switches all sound to the headset, and you're good to go; so much better than all the cable swapping and output settings mess with the PX5. Done with the headset but want to keep playing? Switch it off and the sound will come through your regular speakers. I've never heard even the slightest crackle of wireless interference from where I sit on my couch (my consoles and Roku are wired, so maybe that helps), withconnection starting to break up after about forty feet or two walls, which ever comes first. I haven't tried using them wired to my Vita or phone.  Comfort is well above acceptable, but not quite into spectacular. I have a normal to large-ish head, and find it fits comfortably around it for two-three hours at a time (might be longer; I don't play much beyond 2-3 hrs, if that), and while I'd prefer a slightly more breathable ear cup material, I'm noticing uncomfortable levels of sweat. A lot of the reviews mention the cheap, plastic-y feel of the headset, and I will agree. So far, though, it's only a feel. I doubt these could handle much abuse, but I've traveled with them a couple of times and they have held up. They fold oddly (you'll want to fold the cups symmetrically into the headband, but that's not how it works) so they can be folded and charged at the same time, and the bag is nice for keeping the parts together, but not much protection. Speaking of parts, that USB dongle is both very small and very black. It looks pleasantly unobtrusive in the PS4 (I keep mine plugged in all the time) but it's only a matter of time before that thing disappears into the vortex of essential tiny parts. On the plus side, the blue flashy light on the adapter shuts off after a little while if the headphones are not connected. It would be great if the adapter slid into a slot on the headband or one of the earpieces for storage, but like the materials and the bag, they opted to keep a low price point and focus on sound quality. Ultimately, I think they made the right choice.Battery life is decent, 5-7 hours, and I don't know if they will run and charge at the same time. The battery level is indicated on the screen when it turns on, as are volume adjustments, muting status, etc, which is nice. The app is decent enough; I haven't played with the custom equalizer (don't feel I need to). I set the Destiny specific profile a while ago and have used it for everything. I'd encourage playing with the profiles a little, as I've found they sound better than the default. It's frustrating that the headset can only store one profile aside from default, and that you have to plug the headset into the PS4 to swap apps, so there's no real way to quickly compare profiles. The ability to transmit profiles wirelessly, or at least hold multiple profiles on the headset would be nice. Again, I suspect cost was the issue.So yeah, you should buy this if you're considering a headset, even if wireless isn't essential. It would be a great headset on its own, but for the price it's amazing.\n",

Because I will not lie mic is great, sound and surround is just amazing plus the wireless comfort! However they broke easily around the 6-8 months mark, the design got a fault that even careful people like myself (Yeah I still got the old PS1 intact) will get soon their headsets into pieces. I'm not hating, I'm a Sony fan but I do not recommend at least the headset, headsets costing average $70-99 should be more durable and if you contact Sony even when it is design fault as many 1 star reviewers already marked ,they will do nothing.\n",

I am not sure if there is a USB adapter for android phones/tablets compatible with these headphones, however, I have a bit of a less sexier way to make these headphones work with your android phone/tablet. If there is an easier way to do this, I am sorry for wasting your time and would certainly appreciate you pointing me toward the light. So, I got these headphones and they have been working great with my PS4. No problems at all so far but I've only used them for a few hours now. One thing I wanted to do was pair these headphones with my android phone. The trick for the headphones, obviously, is plugging in the supplied USB dongle to make the connection. How do you plug a male USB into an android phone/tablet?

      "32373619: Painfully mediocre sound. I was pretty excited to get these.  I did a fair amount of research, and most of the reviews are excellent.  First off, my #1 criteria was sound quality.  I was looking for the best sound, without spending almost as much on a headset as I did on the PS4.  These seemed to fit the bill.  During my research, I had found people recommending buying a sound processor and a decent pair of headphones instead.  Since I already had a decent pair of stereo phones (Sony MDR-7506), I decided to also get the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS 7.1 Surround Sound Processor (I also had the necessary optical audio cord, and mini USB power cord), and do a side-by-side test just for fun.  Holy crap was the difference night and day.  I listened to the Playstation Gold headset first, and it sounded good until I plugged the MDR-7501s into the processor.  The 7501s absolutely blew the golds away.  No contest.  Side-by-side, the Golds are flat, dull, and muffled while the MDRs were crisp, loud, and dynamic.  If you are looking for immersion, buy yourself a decent pair of headphones (not Beats by Dre), and get a standalone processor.  Sure, it's not wireless, but if your main goal is great sound quality and immersion, you can't go wrong.\n",
      "21812147: BEST HEADSET IVE EVER BOUGHT I had just bought the turtle beaches stealth 400's and they were ass so I returned them and loved the Sony gold wireless great headset!\n",
      "24103104: Perfect for gaming at night! I use these all the time when I can't play through my speakers because of the volume and they work terrific! The mic works awesome and I like not having the boom mic in my face.The reason for 4 stars is because I wished they were Bluetooth and not require the USB dongle receiver. Boggles my mind why they went this route. If they were Bluetooth, you don't need the wire jack (included) when u want to use the for your PS Vita or listening to music on phone /end rant.Aside from that, I feel these are very adequate gaming headphones. I'm not much of an audiophile but to me these were perfect for my needs and price range\n",

      "22096396: not the best, but not the worst It has all-right sound quality, not the best, but not the worst. My main issue with it is it isn't durable at all. If you are looking for a headset to last you a while this is no the one. My left ear cup broke off and the sound stops playing after about 10 minutes of use and I have to reset it.Note this is about 8 months after I bought it so it does last a while and plays sound fairly well in that time.\n",

      "4003115: Four star for now- now five! Okay so I had this for about 2 or 3 months. I saw that some reviewers said that the earpiece breaks at about 6 months of use. Honestly I think the sound is very good, but I don't know about material quality.  I will need to use it for longer for this to get 5 stars.    Okay so after a long time using this, I haven't had any problems with this headset. The sound could be a little louder but I guess it will give it extra crispy sound when playing strategic games. I like it a lot.\n",

      "50227554: Nice Headphones I love these headphones.  The sound quality is excellent.  The mic works great.  The battery life is great as well.  If you run down the battery, then it is probably time for a break anyway.  I easily get 6-8 hours on a battery charge.\n",

      "11348746: damn good They are pretty good for the price. I have had no problems with them so far and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a headset in the 50 to 100 dollar price range. I would really like to spend a little more and get a true 7.1 surround sound headphones but I don't really have money like that.\n",
      "33493433: Caution, may break easily. I've had this headset for about a year. The overall sound quality and comfort is great. I'm writing this review, however, because I want to warn people about the durability. The headset is made out of plastic, and after using it for awhile one night it snapped in half. Now, for the record I take care of my equipment. No one else touches or uses them. For a piece of equipment this expensive I would expect better. I have the original pair of PlayStation headphones that came out about 4 years ago, and I've gone back to using them.\n",

      "1593403: Much better than the PlayStation silver headset As a previous owner of the silver headset this is much better, sound is better, more comfortable and higher build quality. These are worth the price for sure. Good for gaming, music chatting, movies or whatever.\n",

      "39950501: A must for any serious PS4 player Great headphones for Playing Destiny or your favorite game.  Volume and mute control on the headphones let you control how you want to experience the game also crystal clear voice production enhances game play.\n",
      "464206: Great product. You won't regret. It's outstanding! The sound quality is above what I expected. I now perceive sounds that I wasn't able to hear with the normal TV speakers and my house is a much more quiet. The quality of the materials looks a little fragile but it's just the feeling.\n",
      "38943641: Amazing for this price range. Very comfortable! I can wear them for hours without issues. In stereo mode the sound is impressible good for this price range, in VSS mode not so much. It muffles all the sound. It's not so bad when using the custom preset equalizers (The Last of Us and Infamous First Light). The mic sounds acceptable.One cool feature is that they also work with any PC, just plug the USB dongle.\n",
      "44966886: Five Stars great product...fast shipping\n",
      "1202514: Worth the Value Great sound and quality, my only complaint that it loses connection occasionally. More so on the PS4 than the PS3. Just something to keep in mind. Still a great product that is definitely worth the value.\n",
      "43521619: Top notch headset for gaming Great headset for the price. I currently have a Turtle Beach Black Ops 2 Earforce Tango headset and it's great albeit a little pricey. I picked these up as a backup pair or ones to take with me when traveling. The fit of these are great. After about an hour or so my Tangos tend to hurt my ears but with these, I can play 2-3 hours easily without any discomfort. Overall fit is nice and not too tight or loose. The fact these fold up is a nice little touch too. The sound on these is pretty impressive. Almost on par with my Tango's if not better. Battery life is pretty solid too. I can get about 6-7 hours out of it. Charge time is fast though. After an hour or so it'll get to full charge.The fact this headset only cost $80 is a pretty sweet deal. The VSS (Virtual Surround Sound) is very nice. You can plug it into your MP3 player or phone and listen to music. Doesn't clutter up your setup that much since all you need to do is plug in the USB receiver and that's it.Only major drawback with this headset is the charge cable. Not sure why it's 6 inches long but it should be considerably longer than that for charge a use functionality. My major issue with this headset is the Sound/Chat volume switch. While it's supposed to allow you to control how loud the chat/sound from the game is, it's not all that effective. You basically are forced to choose between really loud game sound or really loud chat. There is no good in between here which is kind of irritating. I use this headset for playing Destiny and there is preset available for it with the companion app from the Playstation Store. This helps make up for the sound issue.Overall, really dig this headset and hoping they holdup for awhile.\n",
      "10307179: Great headset for a great price! I've had turtle beach sets,tritons 720 and axpro(decent product) then I bought the astro a40s(great sound) by far one of the best headsets I've been able to use my only problem was the build quality,my two year old lightly dropped them onto the carpet and a chunk if plastic came off($300 only to have break in 5 months smh)if you can find the Astros for a good price then go with those but if you're on a budget..the Sony gold wireless headset is the way to go..the sound when you download the companion app is SUPERB... You can tweet the mid treble and bass..the bass isn't too crazy but for $100 bucks it is better than a lot of turtle beach sets like the 500p stealth too many issues to name...if you need &#34;quality&#34; sets for a good price I recommend you give these a try...I was highly skeptical reading these reviews but now I know why they have high ratings...my only complaint would probably the same as the astro a40s..build quality but these seem like they can take a few more falls than the a40s...great headset especially with the companion app I was surprised my first time putting them on(oh yeah they're a light headset that won't cause headaches like the trittons I had before)so you'll be able to play longer..battery life is decent I would recommend buying a longer USB 3.0 to charge while you play...once again for $100 there's nothing better..\n",

      "52861622: Very easy to set-up and use First off in the beginning I would have given it 5 stars.  Very easy to set-up and use.  Great sound quality!  Very comfortable!  And then the problems started after a few short months.  The pain problem with the headphones is they NEVER should have made them fordable.  The part that folds uses a small metal pin, held on the sides by a plastic channel.  About 2 weeks ago the right side plastic channel cracked causing the pin to come out.  The only way to keep it usable was to reinforce the outer frame of it with a strip of metal, held in place by DUCT tape.  Then this evening the left side plastic channel gave way, just like the right side did previously.  Again I have to reinforce it with a metal strip with DUCT tape.Keep in mind this was being used by a teenager that has been using PlayStation models since 2003!  He does not beat on his equipment, and has never had an equipment failure as bad as this.  &#34;SONY get rid of the folding aspect, and maybe your product will hold up better to daily use&#34;\n",

      "2768221: Bought 2 months ago Bought these to replace my PX4's - the sound is fairly good for the $75 price tag, definitely comparable to my old PX4's. As far as the microphone goes, I always seem to have a problem every now and again. Sometimes I have problems with my headset not recognizing I am talking so my friends dont hear me. I had to turn my mic sensitivity all the way up so my friends would be able to hear me.Other than the inconsistent microphone, this headset is a decent buy at $75 - I can't really complain with the performance I've gotten based on the price I paid.All in all, it's definitely worth the money if you're looking for a new headset.

I have treated it very carefully and have no signs of cracking at this time.  If you treat your stuff with respect, I expect that this headset will last a long time.  This is not to say that some people with very large craniums will not tax its limits of flexibility, however.  For under $100, you will not find a better deal, IMHO.\n",

      "18961726: If you want to stay under 300 bucks buy these,  don't waste your time and money on TB's. Love it, sound better than both sets of turtle beaches Ive previously owned, my only complaint is about the bass, it's there but it's tame. With the app on the system you can get the most from the headset. Maybe the next gen will have a base boost control built in. Having 7.1 surround sound is great but having it work properly is incredible. TB's 7.1 is OK but it's not great. I was hesitant on buying this but after having two multi hundred dollar tbs crap out in a 4 year span has pushed me away from them. Sony makes other headphones with cleaner sounds so if they do a new model they can definitely still improve but these for the cheap price sound better than almost everything under the 300 dollar mark.  You'll love them. They are a bit heavy being wireless but after a  few 4 hour sessions you'll be used to them.\n",

      "21892291: Great if you are using them for chat and game play at the same time. This is GREAT for chatting and playing a game at the same time. but it is HORRIBLE for using them for music, or anything with bass. The Elite Sony head phones are a lot better quality. Even still, if I was willing to use a cord I would use my Razor Kraken over both pairs for games or movies. I made a custom sound profile with bass set to max and the bass wasn't even apparent.\n",

I use to play on my ps4 everyday for hrs on end and these are very solid and very comfortable headphones although it can get hot around the ears. I play alot of destiny and it's awesome that I can download the companion app and select the optimize preset sound setting for my game (although there are not that many games yet, just the major games released). My only gripe is that I wish it was alittle louder with more bass and the buttons can be designed alittle better. I haven't had any trouble with the build quality also but I also can see how a hinge or something can snap on you. Overall it's definitely worth a buy,  especially on sale.\n",

It's comfortable for hours, whether playing games or watching TV when I don't want to disturb family members. The sound quality is excellent, which is of course the main point: I hear things in games (like Bloodborne) that I didn't even know existed before putting on this headset.My only gripe with this thing is that the earpiece does get sweaty after a long period of use (though I do sweat excessively so this may not be a problem for others). Even so, I would buy this headset again. I can't imagine another headset under $100 with fidelity and comfort this good.\n",

      "11705444: BUYER BEWARE! Very fragile.  I purchased mine through GameStop and wish I'd gone through Amazon as they may have been able to do something about a repair or refund.  Literally 11 months into owning the product the headpiece snapped.  I thought this might be an unusual one-off occurrence but when I went back to the retailer they told me it was a common problem.  They suggested contacting Sony as it was within a year for a warranty repair.  Sony refused to fix as I did not have the &#34;model number&#34;.  Note there is no model number I could find associated with these headphones so that was the first roadblock.  Also I no longer had a receipt (despite the store manager giving me all my purchase info from his system) they refused to repair.  Not sure if this would have been an issue with Amazon as your purchase records are kept on the account.  Overall - while the headphones worked well enough, the fact that they broke so easily (I just put them on my head) was kind of shocking.  The fact Sony did not stand by the quality of their product was disconcerting and makes me hesitant in regards to any future purchases of that brand.  Just my two cents for those considering these headphones.\n",
      "13997266: Is your head large? I reallly want to give these 5 stars and lets say if you have a small head then they deserve 5 stars.I apparently have a large head. Too large in fact. My head is so large its capable of destroying headphones simply by wearing them for a month.If you are looking for some decent wireless headphones with great sound and that will have the plastic snap in several places do to a larger man sized head then get these headphones!.They now make a great low volume desktop speaker!\n",
      "38421509: Buy This! Amazing surround sound abilities.  I can actually tell when things are in front of me, behind, beside and even at an angle.  It's very good at nixing the outside / ambiance noise, but not always perfect.  I definitely recommend this for someone that games in a room with others.  You'll get 99% volume of your game and 1% slight noise from outside.\n",

When I am playing at night, these headphones make it so I can hear my games, while my 9 month old daughter sleeps peacefully and hears nothing.  My only complaint is that the headphones don't automatically turn off when you shut off your PlayStation.\n",

      "47084883: Well worth the price Very good sound, and not having to deal with wires is a breath of fresh air. I should note that I do not use the virtual surround-sound, as I find headphone surround-sound to be off-putting. I did download the app and browse profiles just to test out the process. It was easy enough, though there aren't many games for which profiles have been created.The headphones themselves are comfortable, though they might get warm during extra-long sessions. The cups are roomy without being loose, so head movement doesn't require readjustment. The buttons are easy to locate and responsive. I've seen some reviews mention that the folding hinges on the headband broke; this hasn't happened to me in the two months since I bought them (knock on wood).My one minor issue is that the mic picks up the noise of my fan very strongly. Muting the mic solves this, but obviously if you play/chat online, it's something to be aware of.\n",
      "14601090: Game sound is clear but team mates not so much This is a very nice headset and is comfortable to wear.  Maybe a little tight after a couple of hours of playing.Game dialog, sounds and music sound great.  But other players don't sound as clear.  Like you're on a bad line on a long distance phone call.  But the cost is not too bad for this PS3 wireless headset.\n",
      "10627024: DO NOT BUY Mic quality is terrible. I am being told I sound like I am across the room or in a tunnel. Not worth almost a hundred bucks!!! Don't waste your money....\n",

      "48598662: Really good sound,  Poor Mic I upgraded from the first PlayStation wireless headset and these are very close as far as the sound quality.  The 7.1 simulated surround (VSS) is good, but will make the sounds have more treble, less bass.  I find you can turn off the 7.1 and get pretty much the same depth of sound direction as when its turned on if you perfer the extra bass. The reason these received a 4 instead of 5 star review was because of the mic quality. People have told me that my voice with this headset sounds deeper or muffled a bit. The mic is actually inside the left ear cup, and i guess this causes that problem.  The noise canceling with the mic works really well, my old set had constant white noise, not with this set.\n",
      "10361561: Never Will Buy Another Sony Headset Again!! I'll sum it up quick. I bought these on the &#34;better than black friday deals&#34; for 60$ was about 20$ cheaper. Tried them on went on teamspeak, mic is 1/10 it sounds like i'm being hit by a tornado whenever I activate mic. The sound is meh, not worth the price! The funny thing is I thought mine was defective ,but my buddy bought the same headset also on sale and guess what? Nothing is different. I don't understand where this headset got all these reviews from or if people just ride the sony fanboy train. In addition, while wearing this headset for over an hour expect to get sores because they are extremely uncomfortable!\n",
      "10602069: Not really a good value over time. Bad quality. While the sound was great the controls seemed more complicated than needed. In just under a year the started to come apart at the seems soon after I notice fracture marks that no matter how gentle I was just continued to get bigger till it finally just broke in half. I don't abuse my stuff and it is kept away from my kids. I'm really happy with my new turtle beach headset it is built way better. I don't like to replace my headset every 13 months.\n",
      "29883157: Very good headset Very good headset, but if you wear glasses it could cause some discomfort while using for long periods (2h+)\n",
      "15470555: DON'T BUY! Brittle Plastic I really love the compatibility of this headset, and they are comfortable.  Unfortunately the plastic they rely on to hold it together is very brittle. Here is a link to the Sony forums that shows many customers with the same problem,http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-Peripherals-Support/Gold-Wireless-Stereo-Headset-Warranty/td-p/43482416 many of them turned away by Sony when a repair was asked for.  I have purchased 1 set for myself and 1 for my child, both broke along the top band either at the hinges or just along the top.  I sent my first pair back to Sony with a receipt I had to pry from Game Stop and Sony sent me a new set which broke in the same way within 6 months.  I didn't bother sending my sons back yet because they haven't fallen apart fully, and I haven't tried sending mine back again because I'm pretty sure they'll say no since I don't even know where my receipt is anymore.  Also, my friend owns the same pair and they cracked in the same way, his also won't charge anymore and it's only been a little over a year.\n",
      "11399460: He loved it. Bought it for my kid. He loved it.\n",
      "6729967: Well worth the price of admission. I previously had the PlayStation 3 version of this headset before upgrading to these. My only real issue is that I preferred the audio and chat functions on the older model. They simply had a slider for game audio and one for chat. The newer headset combines both of these functions to one rocker button and it can take a bit of time in comparison to get a good level of hearing chat audio that doesn't over power game audio. The style of the headset is much improved and easier to store thanks to its folding design. Audio is on point and sounds amazing but the feature that allows you to download audio profiles seems more of a gimmick than anything else. I tried it on a handful of games I play and its hard to say if it makes a difference from one to another but that's ok too cause ultimately it still sounds great. My only main issue for not giving it 5 stars is the chat and audio adjustments I mentioned earlier and after awhile of gaming about 2 hours or so my ears start to hurt a bit but that could be because I wear my glasses and have odd shaped ears or something. Not annoying enough for me to stop gaming though. Well worth the price of admission in the long run and a must for any gamer. You don't realize how great game audio is until you wear these compared to standard speakers from you tv.\n",
      "38985584: PC Review I bought these on Prime Day for 61 bucks because I wanted a wireless headset. My current headset's (earforce px22) cords are too short. I can't really lean back on my chair because of it. Here are the list of pros and cons:Pros:-Wireless!! Range is decent. I can cook and listen to music at the same time!-Battery life.-Easy setup. Just plug in the wireless USB, switch your sound settings and you are good to go!-Audio Quality is 8/10. I have read mixed reviews about the audio quality. They are definitely not as good as my Audio Technica ATH-M50's, but don't let that scare you away. It's not the best, but it's not terrible.-Comfortable and great lookCons:-As people have mentioned before, the durability is a bit questionable. It doesn't feel the sturdiest, but so far so good.-Wish I can wireless talk over the phone, but I guess that would require bluetooth.-Mic is not that great. My PX22 mic was better.Honestly if you are in the market for a wireless headset, I think that you won't be able to go wrong with this one. Totally recommended!! 9/10\n",

      "6253583: Great headset! I totally love this headset! The sound quality is great, I can hear even the smallest of the whispers while playing horror games, footstep of incoming enemies in FPS, and the impact of the punches and kicks in fighting games. Besides that, whit the sound app you can install new sound modes that go perfectly with so many games out there. Besides using them on your PS3, PS4 or PS Vita, you can put the wireless dongle in the PC to use them wirelessly!It's also really comfortable, I'm a guy with a kinda large head and I could use these things for hours. They fit perfectly in my ears. Thanks, Sony!\n",
      "9080544: Great Gaming Experience! I had been wanting one of these for some time. I finally purchased one and I am incredibly happy with it.  PROS: The sound quality is outstanding. I have been playing Destiny with the headset provided with my PS4 (blended audio) and since earbuds are not my thing, I wanted to purchase the Playstation Gold. After playing with the Gold, I'm hearing sounds I never heard before in the game AND the surround sound really makes me think that I'm hearing things BEHIND me. It's definitely an intense experience.  Also, my boyfriend needs to wear glasses and he and I were hesitant about how these would fit on his head with his glasses on. They fit perfectly. Ordinarily headphones would put too much pressure and give him headaches, but these were snug but comfortable.  The sound doesn't leak out of the headphones at all. The BF couldn't hear a word I said while he was playing which is a plus for me that way he can play his games and I can continue sleeping LOL  The headphones fold in and and the box came with a carrying case which is great so I don't have them collecting dust.  CONS: The USB charging cable you are provided with is crazy small. It seems like a 3 inch cable. I opted to charge the headset with my phone charger which is also a micro usb charger (Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Fast Charger) so thankfully that was an option.  Other than that, I'm content with my purchase. Happy Gaming!\n",
      "18532998: Better than I thought! These headphones were better than I thought. The comfort, sound quality, and ease of use on the PS4 with different sound settings for certain games and utilizing the Virtual Surround Sound, it's all pretty solid. Battery is pretty solid/long as well, and button arrangements around the headphones are easy to reach. A huge addition is also the 3.5mm jack you could use for PS Vita, PC, or whatever else like mp3 players.The only two things I can say that could question the worth of these is my wonder if this was bluetooth compatible and the price point. It uses a usb dongle, yes it does, but I wonder if it was bluetooth compatible, which can further enhance PS Vita play wirelessly or other ipods/iphones etc.It definitely would have been a great feature. As for price point, I actually bought this during Prime Day, which this was on sale for 59 bucks rather than retail 99 bucks. So I am not sure if I can say the same for everyone if it is truly worth that range, but if you can find it cheaper, it definitely is a good pair to grab!\n",
      "29173310: An all round great gaming headset! Just received this as a gift, and am very surprised at the quality. This is very solid headset.Looks good - very plain and simple design - and the build quality is as good as anything from Razer or Turtle Beach. The hinges and adjustable bands are solid and flex well - no creaking or wobble.The sound quality isn't amazing - for music you'd likely be a bit disappointed but for gaming they're great. Good virtual 7.1 surround - excellent base and nice clear separation. Nothing spectacular but I was very pleased. Microphone is clear and distortion free for chat too which, although I use rarely, is a nice bonus.Wireless setup with my PS4 was as simple as plugging in the wireless dongle on the from USB port, turned the headset on and, voila. Perfect.I have zero complaints so far. Top product, and great value!\n",

      "52849683: What a disappointment these headphones turned out to be What a disappointment these headphones turned out to be.  Having read all the reviews on Amazon I was totally expecting something that worked better than this.  Sound quality was terrible in my opinion.  Way too much emphasis on the highs giving the headphones a tinny sound in most games.  Bluetooth wireless is built into the PS4 yet you have to use a USB stick for these to work.  If a unit supports bluetooth why do I have to keep track of a USB stick?  Hidden mic may sound nice, but the implementation on these headphones just stinks.  Had to jack my mic sensitivity up to max on the console and yet people could still barely hear me.Could have been a defective unit, but I am returning these and moving on to the Hyper-X.  Your mileage may vary.\n",

And thats big to me , if omin a battleground in any game and hearing and enemy at 7 o'clock know that if turn to to the direction of that anbiance you will have a dead combatant. or any game I love my surround sound . its a necessity . and the TB stealth 500s are great for that so the  golds are in the box about to get returned. or put away for a back up.IF WIREOR WIRELESS DONT MATTER THE SKULLCANDY plays are quit nice and priced at $70 they are a steal. money no problem astos are nice the 150s..PS. only on ps4 never tried any set on a PC or X1\n",

      "23019038: Best gaming headset in $100 range! For the price it is the best headset on the PS4. However, it isn't limited to just Playstation products; I've used it to make my laptop, along with anything with a USB port, wireless. If I had to deduct it for anything, it's definitely the range. If I walk out of my room into the hallway I start to lose connection with it. Yet this is a gaming headset, not a walk around the house and do whatever headset, so I guess I'll let it pass.The sound quality is great; you can have the settings exactly as you want them between the game and chat sound. I have also used it to listen to music on multiple occasions and it doesn't seem to distort no matter how high I set the volume. The mic is fine for gaming sessions and I don't get any complaints from my friends, despite the mic hole being so tiny.Overall, if you're in the $100 range, looking for a headset and have a PS3/4, this is certainly the route to go!\n",

      "33919723: The flat sound is EMBARRASSING!!! For the price, this is simply not worth it. The sound is so flat that it's EMBARRASSING!!!! As a producer who takes hours and hours listening to tracks to make sure the sound is perfect by equalizing the right bass and treble and etc. , this headset is a big middle finger to me!! completely ruining listening to music or anything by flattening the sound so much that.... Honestly I can't even explain it. It's just the worst possible sound and it's unacceptable. If you have ever bought earbuds from a Dollar Store, than you know what i'm talking about. I'm not joking it sounds that bad. Now as for game play and watching movies... The &#34;7.1&#34; it claims, does NOT deliver, and yes it still sounds flat. Honestly i'm upset that they let this fly for $80!! and in stores it's $100. I'd recommend buying a regular headset by Sony for around $60. Yes, Sony. For some reason normal headsets like the Sony MDR RF985RK which sounds great, and you can plug the wire straight into the ps4 controller. I never write reviews, but I HAD to write this one. I was so disappointed. $80 for what sounds like the cheapest pair of headphones iv'e ever bought. And at first I thought it was comfortable but when I put on my FAKE BEATS BY DRE that I bought from my friend for $40 it felt and sounded so much better!!! Yes fake Beats that iv'e used over the years. And I just bought this ps4 headset new yesterday!!! Words cannot express. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these. Don't get tricked like I did.\n",

The sound is spot on and regardless of what people say you can adjust the chat seperatly from the game volume as well as adjust the volume as a whole.  The buttons on the side are well hidden and at first you will fumble around for em, but once you get use to them you will be fine. Make sure you read the operators manual otherwise you will have a hard time with the volume like other people did.  It is pretty easy people, don't pay no mind to the negative reviews most of them are to to operator error. You want great wireless surround sound headphones, then these are it! You CANNOT get more bang for your buck.  Hope this helps. -D\n",

      "47105619: ehhhh, alright Sound quality is alright for being $100. My only complaint is the comfortablity of the headset. Mind you I have a huge head (wear a 7 5/8s MLB cap) so these things are right around the ears. After some hardcore gaming, bout 2-3 hours or more, these things begin to get waaaaay uncomfortable. I'm talking swear around your ears and the pressure on my head is unbearable I have to take em off or quit gaming. Also the mic sucks. Others in my house are glad they don't hear gun shots and grenade explosion but what they do hear is me yelling at my friends to get the f*#! Down. That's because this mic likes to make you sound as if you're 20 feet away. You just can beat having a mic on your mouth as if your NSync in a concert. Overall not bad for $100 but wouldn't buy again. Might try turtle beach 500 stealth.\n",

I blame USPS for taking it to the wrong address and the low life pos that decided to keep it along with the $150 order.  Amazon was nice to refund me. Annnnyway, back to the headset.  I've worn these on a 5 hour plane ride and was still feeling comfortable.  When you plug them in to your PS4 you can choose what equalizer to use based on game or &#34;feel&#34; you want in your in-game soundtrack.  I paid full price at the store, but if you can score them on Amazon for a deal it feels like you've won twice.  I've had a side panel pop off when I moved but I snapped it back on and it's solid.  Wireless lasts for a few hours, enough for me to get my game on, put the controller and headset in the charger, and pick it up tomorrow.\n",

The fake leather covering the cushions has started to dissolve already and leaves particulates of fake leather stuck to my head and around my ears. Soon the fake leather will have all come off. This has happened after a few years with every set of headphones I've owned. The material it's made out of is great but does not last and breaks down over time. I'd suggest getting the silver wired headset by Sony as it appears to use a cloth mesh and not foam or fake leather so it should never break down. Sure it's wired but half the time I play with these I have to have them plugged in because the charge doesn't last more than a few hours at a time. Other than that the heaphones are decent over the ear headphones. I rate these very low because for the price the fake leather should last at least 3 years.\n",

      "26707452: Great Gaming/Movie watching headphones! Extremely comfortable pair of headphones. They sound amazing when watching Netflix and even better when gaming. The cups are comfy and they don't cause my ears to overheat. The range is iffy only when you go behind a wall with the headphones on but when your stationed on your couch/chair, they don't disappoint.\n",
      "15507379: So -so Had this headset for about 6 months then stopped playing for some reason the battery is completely dead, yes I tried to recharge it. It was a good headset while it lasted just be cautious of how long you let it sit without using it I guess. The sound was really decent while it worked and it was mostly comfortable. I wear glasses so occasionally if I wore it too long it would end up hurting. Fit well, I have a small head in the end I ended up switching back & forth between the stock earpiece & this. Not planning on buying it again. Good for occasional gamers.\n",

I used electrical tape to wrap it up and continued to use it.  About 2 months later the other side cracked - so I taped that up as well.  Then cracks started to form all along the top of the headset, and the cloth started separating from the top exposing the foam.  I know taping it probably added to the stress put on the cheap plastic but still, I did not expect paying $100 for a headset that only lasted total about 3-4 months.  The quality of the sound was fantastic, I just wish the build quality was better.\n",

Nothing fancy about it.I still prefer the turtle beach headset over this one simply for one reason. Chat and game volume control. That is what this headset is seriously lacking. I can hear the game play fine, but sometimes its hard to hear what your friends are saying due to the game volume as its blended together. Theres no way to turn up the volume for chatting with your friends like the turtle beach headset. Your better off buying a turtle beach headset over this one. This headset will be used for my pc to listen to music and what not.I got this headset on sale during black friday. It was under 50.00 so it was a good buy. Currently its still selling at retail for 99.00 But for that price go with the turtle beach instead.\n",

      "30390011: For the Price, Can't Really Go Wrong I bought these so I wouldn't drive my wife mad with the constant sound of battle echoing throughout our house. I am pleased with the Gold headset. I have had zero issue with connectivity to my PS4. They are comfortable (I have a larger sized head) for hours of gaming. The 7.1 Surround Sound is ok, it definitely doesn't beat an actual surround sound system, but for what I paid for these compared to what you would pay for a true system it can't be beat. The downloadable app (which is free) for the headphones for equalizer settings depending on the game you are playing is a nice touch as well. This is more of a critique for the app than the headphones, some more options would be nice as it has numerous choices for FPS games but lacks for other genresThe sound is crystal clear and the bass is not overpowering, no crackle, no signal loss etc. The range for the wireless headset seems decent, although if I walk into the kitchen, which is adjacent to my living room, the sound will begin to cut out (however the staircase separates these two rooms as well) so that really did not surprise me. However, anywhere in the living room is crystal clear, explosive, shooty, sword clangin' bliss.My only real complaint is that they really do not get very loud and as of yet, I have not been able to figure out another way to possibly increase the volume. Even with chat volume disabled and the main volume controls set on max. I feel as though I am not as immersed as I would like to be, but again they are only seventy bucks. I get a more immersive experience from my Samsung sound bar. Although I am fairly new to the world of gaming headsets (This is my first pair), this may be a standard thing as to not blow your brains out.As for the built in microphone, I don't typically game online and have not really utilized this feature yet. If I do get into some more of the online gaming and begin chatting, I may update this post down the road.\n",
      "47372494: Amazing!!! Ive had this headset for about 5 days now, this is an amazing headset! So for starters anybody wondering about the mic quality, it sounds great ive recorded voice messages on ps4 and it sounds crystal clear none of my friends had issues hearing or understanding me. Thats huge because all the reviews i read or watched on youtube said it was bad or just failed to mention the mic at all but i play a lot of multiplayer games and havent had any issues with it. Also its great to not have a boom mic in your face while your eating haha. Secondly the sound is amazing and all the reviews said this too that sound quality is excelent even when i plugged them into my phone and listened to some dubstep the bass was excellent. Just to clarify im not an audiophile ok! Ive never heard astros or sanhizers or beats so to me these sound awesome. I know people were saying these dont get loud enough...Bull! I was playing advanced warfare and it almost made my ears bleed when i opened a supply drop so they get plenty loud trust me. There is a bit of a learning curve with the buttons but youll get used to that right away. Lets see...oh the sound profiles are cool i wish they had more choices for games but they are pretty good and its easy to change so far ive used shooter, farcry 4, the last of us, and watch dogs. And it actually makes a huge difference from the standard setting. It makes the games come alive. Now the vss mode button is there it works but honeslty its not really a selling point for me, ive tried it in all those games i listed and the only one it seemed to make a diffrence in was the last of us all the other games just seemed to get lower and the volume was already turned up so for the most part its just better to stick to stero which isnt bad cause like i can still tell in which direction an enimies comming from with stero so. One thing i did notice is that its got leather material on the earcups and it is very comfy but it does get a little warm its really not to bad butits noticable after a couple hours which you should take frequent breaks when playing anyways. They are a bit heavy but you adjust to it i think because i was using the ps vita headset it was weird to adjust to having an actuall headset but after the first day i forgot that i was wearing them so they are very comfy. Build quality seems sturdy the hinges that let them fold are made of plastic for some reason but they dont seem cheap its a good value for your money. Oh last thing is the battery life, it actually seems pretty good i havent let them die yet i charged them once in 5 days and the battery wasnt even dead it was at one bar so its pretty good at least it lasts longer than the ps4 controller lol i have to charge that like once a day lol. So to sum it all up this a very good headset if your looking for a wireless suloution that wont break the bank if you do get them wait for the amazon sell cause i got these for like 60 bucks! Which is why i even considered them in the first place cause i was gonna get the p12s but at the time these were $10 more and it was totally worth it...i know its only been 5 days but even if these only lasted 6 months itd still be worth it\n",
      "3020541: Five Stars Excellent Quality & Shipment.\n",
      "10076548: wish I had them first This is my 2 headset that I got for the Ps4 and way better than the first pair of headsets that I got which were the Turtle Beach PX4s. Reasons why they are better is because they arecompletely wireless, connect to a bluetooth usb device, and are way more ccomfortable\n",
      "11137619: Good headset for a good price This is a great sounding headset for the price. The battery lasts several hours even at full volume. The chat is pretty clear but it breaks up now and then. Not sure if this is the headset or some sort of environmental interference. The headset seems durable and folds up for storage in the included pouch. This is a microfiber bag and does not provide significant protection.  Includes a USB dongle, very short charging cable and a cable to connect to devices with a headphone jack. The headset is fairly comfortable but the vinyl ear cups can get hot and sweaty after a while.\n",
      "35837715: Sawing and Games I use them on my PS4 and my digital drums and they are great, they also come in handy when I'm using my circular saw to cut wood for noise cancellation...I kid you not.\n",
      "21675699: Good, but cheap material. I got the white headset last year but I didn't open them till 4 months ago (was waiting for my Siberia headset to finally die)... they are very convenient, comfortable and the sound is nice, 10/10 headset on that aspect.HOWEVER, after 4 months of use, the left side of the part that bends broke. A tiny little plastic holding the metal cylinder broke so it keeps coming off and its a pain to put it back so I had to use tape... I mean the material is some delicate cheap plastic but that was something I did not care much since I do take care of my electronics. It is quite disappointing, it's a nice headset and now it doesn't look as nice because of the tape.I wish I could exchange it :/\n",

      "534413: Five Stars Works seemlessly on PS3 and PS4.\n",
      "24920940: Works as advertised. I didn't expect it to amplify external noises -- it is _not_ noise canceling; in fact, it seems to make environmental noises louder.  This may be by design, but I don't particularly like it.  Otherwise, the sound is decent, and I haven't had any complaints about the microphone.  The battery life is... average?  They last long enough, but you have to charge it pretty regularly.The thing I really dislike about it is that it requires a dongle.  It's a Sony brand, *for* the Playstation (which has bluetooth), and it requires a dongle?  Really?  It takes up one of the _only_ two USB ports on the PS4.  It's a pretty stupid design.\n",

      "617507: Its great, but if u have big ears its not for you This headset is great overall, but i have some gripes about it. The ear cups are a little small and dont have enough cushion for my large ears. So i had to add some in, not that big of a deal but it did hurt my ears after 10 minutes of gaming. Also the headset does not get super load so i cant hear foot steps all the great in a game like call of duty but it works. The wireless is a plus, however, it doesn't like when i go up stairs or into a different room.\n",

I ordered it last June and now, exactly one year later, it is held together by duct tape.  Aside from the low structural quality, you get that weak Sony bass response that has been the way of Sony audio products since the 80s.  range is pretty small no mic boom, but seems to function well. take it to the library with an mp3 player.\n",

      "12274617: Not for me. They sound pretty good and connect easily with good range. Unfortunately they are way to big/clunky and provide no way for yours ears to breathe. I found I could only wear them for an hour or less before my ears were red and sweaty. Also because they are so big it was hard to relax in my recliner when watching movies. Already printed the return form. I decided to splurge and get the Bose SoundLinks, hopefully at $250 they wear and sound a whole lot better.\n",

      "13707894: Save Your Marriage, Buy These Headphones I have owned these PlayStation Gold Wireless Stereo headphones for a year and with the help of my basement man cave, they have probably saved my marriage. Although this is probably overstating things, these headphones have given me an affordable way to game without waking the house up with the sound of gunfire and dying aliens. (Destiny, PS4) All of the buttons, including volume and mute, are raised and well-positioned, making eyes free use easy.Pros:1. Good sound with fairly realistic simulated 7.1 surround. (Helps you locate those Ogres and Wizards that need shooting)2. Comfortable over-the-ear design, that can be worn for hours without pinching or crushing your ears.3. Integrated, and very effective Mic that doesn't poke out in front of your mouth like you're singing in a boy band or answering phones.4. Dedicated balance button that lets you raise the game volume while lowering the chat and visa versa.5. Dedicated mic mute button that is easy to hit once your hands learn the position.6. Long battery life. I have yet to run out of charge during a gaming session.7. Good sound insulation, so outside noises are minimized.8. Stylish. At least that's what my wife says as she smiles and shakes her head.Cons:1. None so far.I would highly recommend these headphones.UPDATE: 10/27/2016 - I have lowered my rating to 4 stars because I have had to replace these headphones after a year and a half of use. About a month ago, a piece of plastic snapped where headphones adjust for the size of your head, leaving one earpiece dangling. They continued to function, but the left headphone dangled from internal wires, preventing them from staying snugly on my head. I used duck/duct tape in an attempt to use them for another month, but in the end I had to buy replacement headphones. Although I would still recommend these headphones based on style and performance, their durability is less than ideal from my experience with them.\n",
      "10678252: Very high sound quality and great for online chat The sound quality of these headphones make it worth the price. It fits very comfortably around the ears and on the head. It's great for chatting as well, but note that the controls and on/off switch should be on the LEFT side of your head (as I found out the hard way) or else people won't hear you. The headphones' position on the headset are adjustable, but are somewhat loose and prone to slip. Overall, though, it's great and can really enhance your gaming experience if you like immersive audio.\n",
      "10702864: Cool look, poor engeniring. Don't do it. I loved how they looked and I really wanted them to work out because they looked so cool. Before I go on I should mention that I am a 40 yr old guy that took EXCELLENT care of these Headset. They big deal with these headsets is that they fold, witch is kind of silly because most gamers don't travel much, they usually play games at home and don't really fold them to travel. Anyways After about 7 months.............. you gusseted it,  they broke right where they fold.  Once they broke I saw how the inside hinge held them together and realized it was just a small piece of plastic that held them together.  I still have the old model ( the ones that don't fold) and after 3 years they are going strong.The sound quality is virtually the same, so stay away from these new ones and buy yourself the older model.\n",

I paid $100 dollars for this headset in 2014. By the start of 2015 I had to super glue the right side back together (the size of my head apparently warped the plastic and caused it to crack and break).I've had the same headset for going on a full year, and it's already needed to be repaired twice. So as for durability, we're coming up on a 2/10.However. The connectivity and functionality is very good. I've only had a handful of problems with having the headset connect to my PS4, all of which were solved by simply unplugging replugging in the dongle.So the bottom line is that this headset functions extremely well and sounds extremely well, however doesn't fit well on a bigger persons head. I am ordering another one because my current one is 100% toast after more then a year of being stretched past it's limits.I would 100% recommend this product to a mildly sized head person. However, it will break under pressure or a larger sized head person.\n",

      "48788863: Great headphones, but you must use USB Great headphones for the PS4. Sounds is great and chat works no problem if you put them on the right way (don't wear them backwards). Just one thing to keep in mind, these are not bluetooth, so you'll have to plug the USB into the port to use them, makes the ps4 look ugly.\n",

      "394150: )The audio doesn't really sound all that good or breath taking when you upload a certain game's ... The headset is ok, but I have 2 main problems with it.  1.)The audio doesn't really sound all that good or breath taking when you upload a certain game's mix into it from the headset app(I haven't used the custom sound mixer yet).  2.) The mic is built into the headset. I thought that I might hate this and with good reason too. My friends on PS3 told me that I sound fine, but on PS4 they told me that I sound kind of far from the mic(but manageable). I also had to slide the right speaker off of my ear so I could hear myself talking as I'm used to how turtle beach mirrors your voice and sends it back through your speakers. With the PGWH I feel either deaf or at least partially deaf and I hate that.  My friend just recently recommended the Logitech G930 because its on sale on amazon currently. I don't have enough money ATM, but I'm going to check out some reviews and if everything is generally good and its still on sale next week then I'll definitely buy it.\n",

      "41576968: Only expect six months As with many of the 1 star reviews here, the hinge on one ear piece broke.  Examination showed it was constructed of too thin plastic with a too large metal rod going through, an obvious design flaw.  I've seen identical damage on other objects using the same design. Cheap. Sony has apparently stopped honoring their one year warranty (this broke after about six months). Online discussions showed they used to honor their warranty, at least in the US.  Not buying Sony anymore.\n",

(very cool)  I was able to make adjustments to chat and game.  (very cool again)  All posts about sound quality are accurate.So why not 5 stars?-Cord is too small to play and charge.-These are plastic and can break easily.  I literally was taking off my head with one hand and this applied to much pressure to one side and it snapped were it folded.  It was a very small piece of plastic that broke off but vital to holding the ear piece on.I want to reorder but I am currently looking at options that can't break as easy.\n",
      "23947630: Sony must've paid good money for positive reviews. I bought these from Target and took them back after 1 week. There is no surround sound, there is no bass; but the headphones do produce regular sound (similar in quality to the stock earbud that comes with the system). During mic testing i couldnt gety voice in the 'good' range even when i increased the recording volume to 100%. My friends could barely hear me, but i could hear them clearly. In contrast, i bought a set of headphones for less than half the price that actually are 7.1 surround sound and excellent mic quality. Im glad i took them back before it was too late\n",
      "3922721: Unrivaled At This Price Range If you're looking for a 7.1 headset for your playstation 4, you have two options. You can shell out for an Astro Headset + Astro Mixer, or you can save hundreds of dollars and pick these bad boys up (along with Sony Silver/Pulse). All other gaming headsets will deliver stereo audio from the PS4, instead of 7.1. Sure, they aren't on the level of the A50s. But those are $300 headphones. This Gold headset retails for a 1/4th of the price. Are they a 1/4th of the quality of A50s? Of course not. For $72, you are getting a pair of headphones that truly deliver in sound immersion, comfort, and convenience. No set up needed. Just plug in the USB adapter and you have 7.1. The audio quality is excellent. The only shortcoming is the lack of bass. Having used the Pulse, I'm glad that Sony chose to forgo the Bass Impact feature on these headphones. The headphone battery outlasts the Dualshock 4's battery. Sony even allows you to customize the audio profile of the headphones. Absolutely fantastic headphones for the price.\n",
      "7955268: Waste of money and time Some of the worst headsets I've ever owned.They were cheaply made and the black panels along the outsides broke off within a couple months. The slider on the right broke within three months, the battery life was always bad, but now after buying them just five months ago it has died completely and refuses to come on even when plugged in.On top of it the mic is in a horrible location on the headsets and its hard for other people to hear you, and the sound quality is &#34;meh&#34; at best.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on these, go buy another brand.\n",

      "22635698: This is literally the worst product I have ever purchased, EVER. Coming from the previous sony wireless stereo headset (http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Stereo-Headset-Playstation-3/dp/B0053OLY9O/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1433703681&sr=1-1&keywords=sony+wireless+stereo+headset)  Before going on with my opinion on this... product... let me give you context, I consider myself a gamer and, whenever I am not playing videogames, I am either using the computer  (listening to music while doing stuff) or just plain listening to music. So, as you would figure, when I am at home I have a headset on me all the time (except for sleeping, bathing, eating and the rest of daily activities). This means that, when I talk about this headset, or the previous version, I talk as someone that uses the product at least 10 hours a day.  This is the worst, literally the worst, theres nothing good whatsoever on this product. At first you will love it, it sounds good and it does what it says, what else could you need?, I really LOVED this product during the first few weeks, sound was great, could use it on my vita (main reason of purchase), could use it on computer without taking a USB slot (unlike previous model) it was THE BEST, the mic never gave me trouble (according to people that held conversation with me, both friends and random gaming people), everything was amazing.  Well, less than a year of having it and it is breaking to pieces, it's not that my head is a gigantic thing, it just started cracking everywhere, I have used industrial adhesives, and tape to keep it together, and thats the only way of having it without breaking apart for a couple weeks, this product is the worst quality ever.  My previous headset (amazon link above) is STILL perfect, it doesn't have a single crack, the only thing it has &#34;wrong&#34; is that its a little peeled off after literal daily use for more than 3 years.  This piece of garbage is breaking apart at year 1, and WILL peel off eventually.  So, now the sound is still good, but it sounds as loudly to everyone around me (it can literally be used as a speaker), it's broken in pieces unless I keep it together and the price tag was WAY TOO HIGH for this low quality, ESPECIALLY because the previous version was cheaper (I believe) and it presents NOT A SINGLE ONE of this flaws after 3 years! (I am sure).  You are better off with the previous model and just some regular headphones for your ps vita, stay away from this garbage.  I upload some photos, every line of tape or adhesive you can see is a gigantic crack going from beginning to end.\n",

      "42525211: More Silver than Gold Pros:- Very comfortable (even wearing glasses)- Sound quality is very good- Built-in mic does the job as well as I'd expect from a non-boom mic- Battery life is good (not great)Cons:- USB dongle is required; I really wish the PS4 supported native bluetooth headphones!- Take a long time to charge; often longer than the 2 hours the PS4 leaves the USB ports on in Rest mode- Folding doesn't dramatically reduce the size of the headphones- Only stores 1 custom sound profile- Sound profiles must be loaded via USBDespite the cons I still give these 5 stars.  They are comfortable enough to wear for extended gaming sessions.  Battery life is acceptable.  So far, durability has been acceptable.  I've had them for 7 months now and have had no issues.\n",

The downsides: after about an hour of use, it starts to hurt my ears, I'm not sure why, with all of the cushion & slanted molding for your ears.

I paid $100 and after 2 months I was playing and when I went to take it of my head the hinge on one side broke, on closer inspection its the plastic that holds the hinge. I take really good care of my stuff and the plastic just cracked. I looked on the other side and it looks like the same thing is happening. Good sound and works great but the construction sucks. The other thing is you have to connect a dongle to the PS4 USB so it takes up one of the ports instead of working using bluetooth. You would figure bluetooth would be built in. I had to put some tape to hold things in place and it works but I can't fold them.My advice is if you buy these try not fold them and open them every time you put them away then use them. Keep them open.\n",

      "10316004: Save your money. When I purchased these headset I was in search of a pair of headsets that can be used to listen to gameplay without having to cut the audio feed of the TV  audio as well as my elgato HD only records from the audio from TV . I had purchased originally turtle beach px4 didn't go well so I got this little guy instead to see if it can provide what I need. I did research and found mixes review majority good so I purchased them. What they didn't mention was that the setup even though wireless would consist of switch the TV audio to the only headset audio. In other words the same exact thing you can do with any other headset. Yes folks you can plug anything from your iPhone headset to a Bluetooth headset of any kind and do the same setup and you get the same thing only thing is your paying the 90 bucks for it to be cordless and bulky with fragile plastic hinges and a figure for bass and treble which can be modified though the headphone companion app. Save your money folks it isn't work the money when you can just buy a normal more comfortable pair for less of a price. I currently purchased the turtle beach 500p for 30 bucks more and it does what I need and sounds great\n",

Given the low price I made the mistake of purchasing a 2nd pair of the wireless gold. (The first set being out of warranty)They broke after 7 moths in precisely the same spot they broke the previous 2 times. The savings, for me, is not worth the time spent on hold each time I need a replacement let alone the money I have to spend to ship to Sony for repair. Suprisingly, even though this is a well known problem with this headset they do charge you to send the broken pair back.\n",

      "42913940: Best headset there is!! I travel every weekend and i was looking for a headset that has a great sound quality but can also be transported easily; this headset is perfect! I've had these for about 6 months now and these have suited my every need: the sound quality, the transportability and the simplicity of this headset make it ultimately the best on the market. Lets start with sound quality, the sound of this headset can compete with any top dollar headset on the market. Ive used this headset for every game I've ever played and have watched many movies with them and, having used headsets such as turtle beach am glad i went with these. In addition the virtual surround button makes it simple to switch from &#34;game time&#34; to &#34;kick back and watch a movie time&#34;. Another huge reason this headset is the best in my opinion is its transportability, since i travel every weekend i needed something that would be easy to carry; thats what i got. This headset has a perfect streamline design with no parts or giant microphone sticking out like with other headsets, i simply just fold them up, put them in the carry bag it comes with and slip it in the pouch of my book bag, these will easily handle everyday uses (Not that you shouldn't treat them like a $100 headset). Not only simple to carry but, when you are ready to use them again (ps4/ps3) just plug the usb adapter into the console and you're ready to go, no wires no hassle. I don't ever write reviews for products but i am all in all very impressed with these, there is no &#34;funny business&#34; it is everything you need: sound quality, long lasting battery, transportability, comfortability, simplicity and nothing more. Also in my opinion i think these look way better then any other headset that is out there. i strongly recommend this product!\n",
      "23904767: Great headset but not too durable this was my first gaming headset so i did not know what to expect. Loved this headset. However, the hinge did break after a year so I would not say they are the most durable. Still a good buy in my opinion\n",
      "38102068: unacceptable. The headset constantly disconnects from my PS4. So i did some research... come to find out this is an issue a lot of people have had. I tried every fix people had thought up. i changed my wifi channel to every possible channel, nothing. i reset the headset, and dongle probably ten times, nothing. finally, i purchased a usb extender cable to get the dongle far away from the console. i place the dongle high up, down low, right next to the headset... still nothing.  i have been buying Sony products for a LONG time, the name has always meant &#34;top of the line&#34; High quality&#34;. Until now that is what i have gotten. This is very disapointing to say the least. Although the headset does seem to work for some people, judging by reviews, MOST people. I would advise you look elsewhere for yours. its simply not worth the headache.\n",

      "11093244: The Sony Gold Wireless Headset is excellent. For the money The Sony Gold Wireless Headset is excellent. For the money, I don't think you'd find a better gaming headset.For the last two years, I used the original Sony Pulse (not Pulse Elite) set and I liked it but it had a few small issues that are corrected by the Gold set. That set suffered from occasional disconnections. It didn't make the set unusable but it was annoying because it would disconnect at least once or twice for every hour of play. It reconnected itself after a few seconds most of the time but sometimes it took longer and sidetone settings would be reset upon reconnection. The set was also unusable for anything other than game console and PC use since it was exclusively wireless. The Gold set has not had any disconnections over my first few weeks of use and it also includes a wired option, which makes it usable with every device and also is great as a backup option when the batteries are dead. Wired use requires no power from the headset.Other good things about the headset are the eight hour battery life (double that of my Pulse set), great virtual 7.1 surround sound, ability to use custom EQ settings that game developers release for their games, light and comfortable, folding headset for compact storage, and the headset comes with its own carrying bag. I've switched to this headset full time for all my devices (PS4, Mac, Vita and phone) so it's great that it comes with its own bag.I should also mention that the mic is crystal clear. I've been playing with friends for a few weeks and they've all said they can hear clearly. A friend of mine also has the same set and he sounds great to me. You will occasionally hear negative reviews of the mic but these are from people wearing the headset backward, the mic is only good when worn properly. With an integrated mic rather than one with a boom (another great feature over the Pulse set, which had a flimsy boom), it's easy to see how someone could wear them backward.All told, this set is outstanding. I was able to get mine for $69.99 but even at the full $99.99 asking price, they are worth it. Unless you are a hardcore audiophile, you can sell every other set you have and use this full time with all of your devices. It does it all.told, this set is outstanding.

      "39366498: Better than Pulse Elite Edition I switched to this headset after using the Pulse Elite Edition for a little over a year. I find it much more comfortable to wear than the Pulse. Sound quality is just as good if not better. Better battery life. It uses Micro-B USB cable like the Dualshock 4 controller so if you're using a PS4, you can keep the same cable plugged in at all times without having to switch to the Mini-B cable like you'd have to do with the Pulse Elite.Overall I'm loving my new headset.

The built in mic seems to work just fine as others were able to hear me just fine. However I do not recommend using the headset application on the PS4 with these because when I did it just made it all crackly and choppy unless they updated the application; I just haven't used the application for quite some time now so it might be better now.

      "48242055: BEST GAMING HEADSET PERIOD!! These are AMAZING. I'm not really sure where to start these headphones are absolutely the best gaming headphones I have owned so far. They make the game sound like it is designed and meant to sound, they are very easy to use and figure out, ha a mute button if you don't want to talk, if you want the best get these.\n",
      "43822370: Terrible Mic Fit is OK but the mic is really horrible. Nobody will hear you with that built in mic.Save your money and get nicer headphones with a cheap clip on mic. Look at the ATH-M50x product.\n",
      "1171167: No Bass = No good I own this headset and I gotta say the Bass is Horrible!!! I could almost say is completly absent.I'd like to know if the Pulse Elite have better bass than this Gold crap, I seriously think about switching to the Pulse and throw this one out the window.\n",
      "1017704: fatal design flaw Have had this headset sense Christmas and although the sound quality is great and using them is easy I wouldn't recommend this headset for anyone. Sony overlooked a fatal design flaw when the headset was made. They were made to be foldable for easy transport and storage but the problem is cheap plastic for the hinges. Both sides of my headset and all the hinges have broken. For the price of the headset this shouldn't happen. Buyers be ware this will happen to you buy something better than these they are not worth the price.\n",
      "4883420: Good for the ps4 and PC but I wished I could use it on other devices I received this from amazon one day faster than it was supposed to arrive.It was carefully packaged and at first I thought I only need to turn it on and look for it at the bluetooth device section but it wasn't there.Edit: of course what I meant was you can't use this on bluetooth mode for your iphone or ipad, but it does come with a aux cable so you CAN use it as a headset, but only as a wired headset.Tips:Once you unbox it, look for the wireless sensor. It's half the size of a USB stick.Stick it in your ps4.Go to audio devices and you'll see it at the output section.Anyway the sound is good, I primarily use this to watch netflix using my ps4.I wish I could use it on my iphone and ipad.\n",
      "429246: Looks nice. I would pass though. Very disappointed. They were fine for a two months, now the ps4 will not recognize the dongel.. meaning its a paperweight at best. 5 stars because it looks and feels amazing. Then you lose 4 for only working for only 2 months. I am seriously disappointed. Honestly..\n",
      "13068053: Buy this...immediately I went from a Playstation bluetooth headset straight to this and I was blown away. I honestly can't believe how much better everything sounds. I am a father and play sporadically but when I find time, battery life seems to be pretty good on it. It only takes a couple hours to charge and you are good to go. It also works as a wireless headset to listen to music on my PC. The usb stick just needs to be used wherever you want to hear the audio. I can't recommend this enough for any gamer.\n",

After just over a year of very gentle usage, the plastic hinge on the right side has broken and I've had to tape it back together. No qualms at all with the sound quality, comfort, and the wireless adapter (works great on my PC/PS4/PS3), but build quality is poor.\n",
      "48348010: Great inexpensive headset! This headset is awesome for the price.When i first opened the package it made me think that it was not wireless and i had to plug it into the controller, after a lot of playing around I figured it out.The sound in these things are awesome. I use them to watch movies to get that surround sound effect. It's nice being able to turn down the game sound vs chat sound. I would recommend these to anyone.My only complaint is that they are kind of heavy and if you have gauges they push them into your neck. (I usually take mine out for comfort)Other than that, it's a GREAT headset!\n",
      "30101046: Excellent headphones, with one MAJOR flaw I was in love with these headphones, until they recently broke on both sides, where they fold.I get it, you want them to be convenient so you can fold them and store them away. The least they could of done was reinforce them with something stronger than flimsy plastic.The sound is terrific and the mic is perfect, but the craftsmanship and durability is why I'm giving it 3 stars.\n",
      "7445645: Best Headset on the Market I have been using this headset for about a year and a half now and they are phenomenal.  I use them for gaming on the PS4, PC gaming, and just general headphone use like watching videos or listening to music.  By far the most comfortable headset I have ever tried,  I can wear these for 8+ hours straight with no fatigue.  I use them every single day and they have fell off tables and been sat on, but they don't even have a scratch on them.  Sony really hit it out of the park with this headset, and if mine ever breaks it will be replaced with the same pair immediately.\n",

      "45484601: Broken beyond repair My headset is about 9 months old now. The ear piece comes off a lot but you just have to put it back on. One side broke about 5 months ago and I taped it on and it was okay. Now, the other side is broken and taping it isn't working. I have to get new ones. This headset is not very durable at all! For this price it should have lasted longer. I'm very careful with it and I'm not throwing them around or anything. I give it three stars because the sound quality is good. It works on my PC and PS4. But, now they are worthless.\n",

      "35159209: If you have to duct it..... Four months into use, the plastic hinges began falling apart. The top plastic covers warp and crack easily with any sort of force applied. I contacted Sony to see if I could have this product replaced. Sony stated that workmanship of this product is not covered. So I'm stuck with a headset that does not properly sit on my head and is held together by duct tape. I believe this product is made from the same materials that the PS4 controllers are made of.....\n",
      "13015768: ... son \"gamer\" he said the head phones are very good and comfortable Product was purchased for son &#34;gamer&#34; he said the head phones are very good and comfortable. The microphone however leaves a little to be desired.\n",

The sound is very good and i loved using but the only down fall i found was the head band is made of hard plastic.I went to use them the other day and the head band broke just before the joint of the left ear head phone. At $ 100.00a set and not being warranted for that kind of upsets me. I think an unbreakable headband should be put on the headset.But in ending the set works very well.\n",
      "13566478: Amazing but watch out! Amazing headset. Sound is amazing and you can easily adjust the party & game volume in the middle of a game. Battery life can go on all day if I keep them at mid volume. Have had them for a year till now.My wife and I each owned one till a couple months ago. The part that folds inside for storing the headsets easier caused the plastic bits inside to break even though she took great care of it. My set finally broke today when I was simple sliding them off. Duct taped mine but feels weird since one part bends outward no matter how much tape is placed.Sound still works, it's just really awkward since after time the right ear has too much pressure applied to it from the weirdly angled ear part. Personal experience from my wife since we are still looking for a good headset like this.It's a great buy but would love for there to not be this folding part because it wouldn't have broken in the first place. So make sure to save your receipt incase it breaks before a year passes.\n",
      "30043939: Gets the job done, nothing more. Not that comfortable... very lightweight. Sound quality is mediocre at best. I thought this would work wirelessly on my PC or with my phone, which is my own fault, but this was a secondary use.I ended up only using this for Destiny, but grouping on that game was so hard to get going that I barely used it. Bought a better headset for my PC.\n",

      "49553741: Adds to the experience and nice privacy option The only thing I regret with these headphones is that I did not get them sooner. While playing games with the TV sound has always been fine, hearing even more distinct and clearer sounds with the headphones on makes it an even better experience. I also watch Netflix when I goto sleep each night, and if my girlfriend is sleeping, or if she is watching something on her Ipad, I wear the headphones and she isn't affected by what I'm watching at all. They are comfortable on the head, and don't take too long to charge, though they need re-charging every few days. Overall VERY happy with them and would highly recommend them to anyone.\n",

      "32590228: Great Product, just way too tight for large headed folks. It has great sound, easy setup, good mic quality. I like the look and the material.The thing that made me hate it though and throw it in a drawer never to be seen again though was the fact that it literallyturned my ears raw. It was super tight and uncomfortable no matter how much I adjust it.Granted I have a rather large head with a 7 5/8 hat size and that might be it, just a shame that it didn't work out for me.Everything about this headset is awesome except it is very tight so if you have a large head, do yourself a favor and get amore comfortable headset.\n",
      "52814639: Awesome Headset for the PS4! The only &#34;negative&#34; is the fact that you're forced to use one of your available two USB ports.\n",

They are a bit tight on my head at times and can get warm when wearing them for long sessions.  I wish the app that Sony provides would have custom settings for more games that I play.  It doesn't seem like they update it as often as they should.\n",
      "24567510: Not bad, But One Stop Short From Great When I bought myself a PS4 and I saw that they had made headphones, I was a little skeptical, as it was a PlayStation made headset. To my surprise it does pretty well in the circumstances. I live in a condo with thin walls, so having this helped tremendously. Even without the companion app, the sound is pretty immersive. I stop short of giving it 5 stars because of the build quality. Other than that, well done Sony!P/S: Download the companion app, with more sound packs coming for games, it will not disappoint.\n",

They are very comfortable to wear and after a while you don't even know you have them on and I wear glasses which headphones usually make my ears hurt after a long time.  The built in microphone work great even when speaking at low volumes, I work nights so when everyone is asleep and I'm playing games I can't talk loud so this work perfect.  The only draw back is the fact you can plug these headphone into your wireless controller using the 3.5mm cable (provided) but your microphone will not work just audio only.  I originally had the PlayStation Headphones for the PS3 but every time I would plug the USB wireless transmitter into the PS4 I would lose my connectivity to the wireless internet.  These new headphone correct that problem, I played online last night for hours with the USB wireless transmitter plugged into the PS4 and it worked perfectly including the microphone.  They give you a very short USB charging cable for the headset but you can use the same one that came with the PS4 to charge it up or have it plugged up while you are using them.  Sony has produced another great product!\n",
      "45231031: Definitely the best headset I've ever used from any device ever owned in this house hold! What can I say, it's just perfect! The most comfortable headset I've ever used and I originally come from PC gaming where I've had so many different expensive brands of headsets that so many gamers recommended and none come even close to the comfort of this headset! It's the absolute best I've ever tried! I just might buy a second one soon!\n",
      "51554651: Just do it! Overall a great headset, kind of bulky while storing or charging. Performance for the price is hard to beat, and the build seems to be fairly solid. I would recommend for anyone wanting a great headset without taking out a loan.\n",

      "31697124: Really Poor Mic I bought these so I could hear my games and movies over the traffic and fans. For that, they work great. They lose two stars however for a few things.1) The mic is terrible. It is low on bass and mids making it sound underwater. It also has that good ol digitized sound due to under sampling rates. The mic that comes with the PS4 sounds 100x better and &#34;free&#34;.2) They are hot and heavy - not comfortable for long periods of time.3) The sound is only okay and you can only assign one preset at a time where there are two preset positions on the switch.4) These aren't Bluetooth. They use a dongle that takes up one of your USB ports. Why they couldn't go with Bluetooth is beyond me.\n",

      "45137879: I can't be more happy that I decided to order this product I can't be more happy that I decided to order this product. Yes, they came charged. Awesome! Anyway... after opening the box, the setup was as simple as plugging the USB receiver into my PS4, changing the sound output on the PS4 to &#34;headset&#34; and then adjusting the volume on the headset itself. The 7.1 sound is amazing. I played the game &#34;P.T.&#34; and I was scared ****less the entire time. Creepy, scary and horrifying sounds all around me. I then had a friend test the mic quality with me and he said I sounded crystal clear, even more so than when I used the &#34;ear bud&#34; included with the PS4. After that, it was on to Mortal Kombat X, where I got to hear every single crack of bone and every &#34;glop&#34; of flying blood particles. If it's legal in my state, I may just marry my PS4 and adopt these as my own.\n",
      "4865753: fantastic headset. Fantastic headset, easy set up. Software integrations with the PlayStation are really convenient, and if you're like me and still have a ps3 sometimes, it's just a matter of switching a USB gumstick.Notable pros7.1 surround is notably better than what was offered by my former headset (turtle beach px4) and there's a separate volume button to adjust voice vs game chat, which is a preferred to playing with the party chat menus.Notable consBattery life! Won't matter unless you're playing for hours and hours at a time like I sometimes do. It's similar to the DS4 in this sense, but the charger it comes with is about 3 inches long. I find myself quitting playing for a while to charge when it gets low, which is much more often than my previous headset, but maybe that's a good thing. It's not quite as comfortable as other headsets but that's something you get past easily.Overall, a fantastic headset for the price, I'd say it's the best you can get right now.\n",
      "47801074: They both are very happy with this headset My brother got these for Christmas and then my boyfriend insisted he needed them- so I got them for him for his birthday.

The stock earbud / mic that comes with that system is horrible, and I needed to replace it. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this headset. The lack of a mic arm is very nice, also the ability to adjust levels between the game sounds and voices in your party is fantastic. Overall I couldn't be more pleased with this thing. Then a funny thing happened; I was doing a rare bout of PC gaming the other night, and my super-expensive Logitech headset decided to give up the ghost mid-game. I was frustrated! The next day I went on Amazon to find a replacement for my PC gaming headset. While browsing through the available offerings I kept seeing the PS Gold headset coming up, and I was perplexed because I thought it only worked on consoles. So I plugged it in to my PC, and the thing just worked, and worked better than my old one. I was so flippin' pleased by that, that I had to come here and write a review. Bottom line; if you are on the fence about spending your hard earned cash on this headset I'm here to tell you, you won't be disappointed.\n",

The set up is extremely simple and I'm very pleased with it. The only noticeable downsides to it are the size, I have a very large head so it kind of squeezes my head during prolonged usage but throw in a few breaks and that's no biggie.

The lack of a mic in front of your face that you're constantly adjusting is a plus. No wires is also one of my favorite things and as long as these are charged, using them is as simple as picking em up and putting them on. The range is pretty impressive. I've found I can get up and go into my kitchen a good distance away and still be talking with my buddies without problem.The -only- minor downside is you're going to be memorizing where the buttons are on the ears.When I first started using them I would have to take them off on occasion to see which was mute and which was volume vs the chat/sound buttons. Easy enough to get over when you start using them enough!\n",

I wanted something nice to use with the Playstation that delivered quality sound without breaking the bank....I also wanted a set that didn't have that goofy mic sticking out.I know some people say the hinges are flimsy, but honestly I don't fold them up. I have used them around my house for phone calls on my laptop for work and conference calls, but other than that I don't carry them anywhere say they stay open all the time.Unless you're going to be carrying them around I'm sure you won't have much of an issue. They provide a good value for the price.\n",

      "11382754: DO NOT BUY!!! CHEAPLY MADE AND WILL NOT LAST!!! Just like all the rest of the bad reviews, I only have one complaint, but it's a HUGE complaint when you drop $100 on a headset expecting them to have a lifespan as long as your console. Had these for about six months and then one of the small plastic pieces securing the hinges broke. I take care my things, so I KNOW these were not messed with or under any more stress than usual - simply putting them on and taking them off and ONLY folding them for travel. The sound quality is great, but the chance of this happening are far too great. Although I loved this headset they are bound for the trash and I will NOT be throwing my money away on another pair. I'm extremely disappointed!\n",
      "24880535: Here is the trick to a purchase like this one Here is the trick to a purchase like this one. I get a used pair of headphones for $20 less than retail but what you get or what I got was (The headphones and the Bluetooth receiver) so technically I received what I bought but what wasn't included in the listing was It doesn't come with the retail box, instructions, wires and cables or exactly clean or signs of wear in the faux leather with head juice all over it. Disgusting . So was it worth the money ? NO I should have never canceled the new ones because they were not in stock . The only thing going for them is they work but I will never have a order like this again.\n",

      "38652297: Good headset for the money that falls just a little short The Gold Wireless gives you a pretty good bang for your buck - its comfy (take it from someone with big ears), its light, it gives good sound quality and the controls work great.My ONLY quip with this is the range - if I'm wearing this and walk from my living room to my room, which is literally 10 feet away - it starts to get staticy and give out. Same deal if you use it on a laptop and are listening to music and decide to go get a glass of water from the kitchen. Probably not a design flaw, its meant to be a gaming headset so more often than naught you wont be more than 5 feet away from your PS4. But, still. For a $100, they could have made this a little better.\n",

The sound is good for a gaming headset (don't expect Beyerdynamic DT 990 or AKG K612 type sounds), but at the price level the sound is good.  The mic is so-so, but people in my parties can hear me without issue.  The real concern is the comfort level.  For my medium sized head, I feel like the headset has quite a bit of clamping force.  With comfortable full sized headphones or headsets, I usually forget that they are on after 10-15 minutes.  With this Sony headset I am always aware of the cups pressing into my head.  The cups are comfortable at first, but they trap in a LOT of heat.  After a few hours of gaming, I need to take the headset off to release the pressure on the sides of my head.That said, the uncomfortable fit may just be my head.  Other than comfort issues, I find the Sony Gold to be a good headset.\n",
      "36165267: Good headset for PS4 and PC gaming Pretty awesome headset for the price. It's comfortable, solid sound and the mic is pretty good, battery life is more than enough for hours long sessions. The build quality is good, feels well built and not flimsy like a lot of foldable headsets do.  I love the fact that I can use it (and do) as a PC headset, not just a for my ps4. This for me is a 5 star product, simply because for the price point you get all the features you could ask for.\n",

I bought these so he could game without blowing our speakers and I could live in silence. I would HIGHLY recommend these for any girlfriend/wife/friend/parent who is tired of listening to video games on blast. These have been a life saver and I am so grateful that I no longer have to listen to the same levels being played over and over through the night. So worth the price and they really are amazing headphones.\n",

      "14913368: Horrible build quality. On first receiving these I would have given them 5 stars. For the price the sound quality is excellent, the wireless works well, and the battery life is decent.  In my opinion they look great and they're extremely comfortable.Then a few months later they fall apart. Just as a lot of other reviewers have said, the hinges that hold these together are extremely flimsy. There are two tiny little bits of plastic on each hinge that take all of the stresses of the hinge and when they fail your set is ruined. I am careful with my stuff and these weren't abused in any way. I wear them when I game and set them on the entertainment console next to my PS4 when I'm not. They've never been dropped, thrown, stepped on, or abused in any way. The only stresses they've ever been subjected to are being placed onto and removed from my head and still, they broke. I fixed the broken hinge with some duct tape (classy, I know) only to have the other side break just a few weeks later.I love my PS4 and was inclined to like these but I'm sorry to say that the build quality is just garbage.\n",

      "37378784: good but slightly disappointed Every review I read for this headset was &#34;amazing&#34; for the price. I must say I'm little disappointed with sound quality. I had 5.1 surround sound set up since ps2 era and even though my setup wasn't top of the line, PS2 to PS3 jump changed sound quality greatly. The clarity I heard from MGS4 is still one of to beat in games and use of surround sound effects on Dead Space left me in awe. Sadly, this headset doesn't give you that clarity or surround sound effect. It does deliver more punch than your TV but it doesn't come close to any 5.1 setup. I tried this headset on both PS3 and PS4. Doesn't need additional setup other than plugging in USB. You can hear slight changes with virtual surround sound option but again, it's nothing like actual properly placed 5.1 or 7.1 setup. Battery life is decent and can be charged using ps4 controller charger. It worked right away on Mac wirelessly and was able to make FaceTime calls using mic with ease. PC took little longer to setup but it was a breeze too.Pros-great wireless headset for PS3, ps4, pc, Mac-easy plug n play set up for most-decent battery life-better than typical earbud headset or TV speakersCons-Virtual surround sound isn't surround enough-clarity isn't upto par with typical surround sound or high end headset\n",
      "6331879: The headset is comfortable for an hour The headset is comfortable for an hour, but after that, the leatherette ear cups get hot an make my ears itchy. The sound quality is sub-par at best: it sounds very artificial, if that makes any sense. The microphone is atrocious- my friends all say that I sound like I'm talking into a tin can. I know I don't have a faulty headset either, as my friend has a Gold, and be sounds terrible. The button layout is confusing and unintuitive, which results in me fumbling with the buttons before giving up because it is impossible to achieve the right volumes. There is also an annoying beep accompanying the volume changes which cuts out all other audio. The battery life is average at best, the companion app does little to better the poor sound output, and it is too easy to put the headset on backwards, which makes you sound even worse to your friends.I haven't even gotten to the worst part.There are two volume rockers- one for game volume and one for chat volume. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. Both the rockers will only change the game volume, so if my friends are too loud during a cut scene, I have to either leave the party or fiddle with the settings for an hour until I can no longer hear my friends. I could overlook everything else, but this oversight tips the headset over the edge. Under no circumstances would I recommend this one.I got this headset looking for a suitable replacement for my broken pair of Turtle Beaches. It seemed like a good value, and the specs were on par with my Turtle Beaches. It took only five minutes to realize that I'd made a terrible purchase. Take it from me-  spend a bit more on a good pair of Turtle Beaches or Astros: you won't regret it.\n",

      "45603413: Fantastic Headphones. These things are awesome. The sound is clear, the microphone is nice. The headphones have all of the controls within easy access, the accessories that came with the headphones are fantastic.

I would highly recommend these for any ps4 user who wants to get the most from the gaming experience.\n",

Plus they want to fall off my head fairly easily, and tightening them is only worse for my ears.  Volume is a bit low for the softest of soundtracks\\soundeffects\n",
      "5016117: beware These headphones sound amazing.They might just be the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned.There's just one problem,I've had them for no more than 12 hrs and already there are cracks on the joints where the ear cups fold in.The actual sound is great, they are very loud crisp and clear.It brings sound to life and have a pretty decent battery life.I used mine for the first time for well over 3 hrs and only lost one bar of battery.I walked halfway through my house with the sound still working so range seems great as well.The build is nice and modern but should be reinforced a bit more.I didn't wanna believe all those bad reviews, simply because these headphones are so comfortable and sound alot better than my wired pair of turtle beaches.But just as in almost every bad review...they broke.I should also note that when you talk, it's very hard to hear yourself.Even with the different profiles on the companion app.this was a big let down for me as it makes it feel as if no one else can hear you.All in all I would pay the $99 for these if they were a bit stronger.But after noticing hairline cracks after only a few hours, these are going back.\n",

The outer shell is plastic and just cracked putting it on my fat head. After that I was a little mad because I put 100 dollars down for them....wasn't going to complain though not a big deal they were still wearable because of the plastic running through them but now the ear has fallen apart and I am furious I would suggest finding a better headset although the features via ps4 are cool for these with specific game sound controls they always irritated my ears and were small on my head. Can't see a reason to purchase a poorly designed product.\n",
      "22329290: Not for big heads If you've got a small head, you can ignore this since mine is huge (7 5/8 hat size) and the head squeezing is the main reason I hated these. I've used the original Playstation 3 headset since it came out around the end of 2010. I have loved every minute of using those, I was just hoping for a longer lasting battery charge with these Golds. I was only able to listen for about 10 minutes before I had to pack them back up. They squeezed almost as much as the Pulses and I knew immediately that they had to go back. The sound quality was pretty good, no better than my PS3 headset. In summary, I love the original PS3 headset (the Princess Lea ones), hated the Pulses and hated the Golds.\n",

I can play the chat and game audio through the headphones so I don't have sound blasting through my small house. The charge last a good while and I have not had any trouble with it in the 20 hours I've used it so far.

One of the pieces of plastic that holds the pin in place broke off this month making it difficult to even use the headset.  It was still under warranty (1 year), so we called Sony to see about repairs.  Sony only warrants the speakers....wires....connectibility of the headset....not the band.  They do not even replace the band if you offer to pay them for it.  We take very good care of what we own, so it was a big disappointment that it broke.\n",

I use them just as headphones at night, or in the morning, when I can't blast my 5.1 system. The sound quality on these is excellent. Very crisp high and mids, and punchy lows. I'm astonished at how surroundy the virtual surround sound sounds. A truly amazing feature that feels like I'm listening to a 7.1 system.The 'phones are easy to connect, and the few game-specific settings sound even better while playing those games. Playing The Last of Us Remastered with these babies on creates a very haunting experience. The headset is fairly light and comfortable. Not quite as comfy as my Bose AE2s, but pretty darn comfy. Buy them. You won't regret it.\n",
      "1295831: super fast shipping AAA++++\n",
      "1336074: 4.7 Stars! A few things: I just got these and have only used for an hour or so. Playing Destiny. Coming from using the built-in speakers on my LED TV. Destiny is a shooting game (loud bangs, sweet sci-fi sounds) and built-in TV speakers are... crap. Always crap. So, naturally, these headphones are going to sound extra good to me.With that said, they're pretty awesome.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Sound Quality:4.5-star. Not as powerful of bass as I had hoped, but my rocket launcher with cluster bombs still sounds very nearly EPIC. I don't really want to use any other heavy weapons because the cluster bombs sound so cool. (If you don't play Destiny, imagine a really deep, clear BOOM). The volume level gets plenty loud for me. Can't hear my fire alarm warning me that the battery is almost dead anymore! I am not sold on this VSS option. I have found that, with Destiny, at least, I prefer the VSS off (at least I think it's off according to the icon that shows/disappears when I hold the VSS button for 2 seconds). But it's not like the sound becomes flat, it still has that surround effect whether this option is on or off.I want to point out that when I first read the 'how it's meant to be played' stuff on the box, I didn't think much. But when I fired my first shot with these things on, and started running around, I just could not believe all the little sounds I had never heard before!!! I have played Destiny for maybe 400 hours and I've just now heard a lot of these cool sounds. This is a sci-fi shooter title made by a very high quality production studio, so these are sounds that you'd hear in a Hollywood blockbuster. Just pure awesomeness. I literally sat there thinking &#34;Does the game know I'm using these PlayStation headphones and now it's playing higher-quality, more detailed sound? So that they can get awesome reviews? Because that would be really genius. Either way, this was $90 well-spent&#34; and thenI took another puff, sat back, and developed shell-shock during a PvP match from the terrifyingly loud and up-close melee attack sounds. Dude those f***ing lag-bags get a melee off on me while your body is dissolving in a purple haze you kidding me you...::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Comfort:Great, nice cushy leather padding.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Build Quality:Excellent. 5-star. VERY solid feeling. We're talking Bose quality build. Or Apple, if they made headphones like this. The packaging was nicely done as well.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Ease-of-Use:3-star. One of the main reasons I gave it overall only 4-stars. Don't get me wrong, setup was extremely easy. BUT, the instructions for setup are basically all that come with the product. The on/off switch has 3 settings: OFF/1/2. I could not find anywhere in the documentation that came with the product on what the heck the difference is between 1 and 2... Also, the 'Sound/Chat' buttons: can't figure it out, doesn't seem to do anything. Volume button makes sense. VirtualSurroundSound button makes sense (once you realize you have to hold it for a couple seconds). For answers, you're apparently supposed to go to the website. I would really prefer these details available in a damn product manual in the package with the product... do they just want website traffic? Who knows. Was disappointed in the product manual, though.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Price:I would pay 50-100% more for these headphones. So yeah, price is great.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Microphone:No clue, haven't talked to anyone yet.\n",

I have two friends who bought the same headset and that's how I know for a fact that it's not just mine. All three of us sound like C3PO betas. 2) Because of where the microphone is positioned (inside one of the earpieces itself) any physical contact AT ALL with the headset is amplified and transmitted through the microphone to anyone who might be listening.The sound quality is very good and the wireless feature is great. But to anyone thinking of purchasing this product I recommend you keep searching. There are other headsets out there that are much better quality, especially for $100.\n",

I'm very careful with any equipment of mine that you wouldn't even be able to tell it was used. I go as far as never stretching the headset more than necessary for it to slide onto my head. Despite all my caution the plastic still somehow cracked on me which caused it to snap in half due to wear and tear.\n",

I was scared that this was going to be crap, as i have had in the past, had bad experiences with other headsets & microphones plus namely turtle beach, no offense turtle beach sorry.#1 reason i loved this is i am E.L.F & Electromagnetic sensitive, i know in this day in age people scream there opinion of what doesn't exist & what does all based on there sole individual perception of what the heck one persons human body is capable of & then make comparison just from there own experiences (reason for this to me is people are overly competitive for no reason) & i am fine with that but i had to live my life no one else & each time i put on turtle beach i don't know why but i would get a headache over time, i put these on & nothing, to boot i have fallen a freaking sleep in them that is a plus10 bonus with 10 golden kiddy stars in my book! there has even been times where i just left my room with them on & forgot they where on my head! xDP.SI am very good at spotting possible bad out-comes or possible wear & tear on individual products.This headset folds in, if a person where to say fold them to many times or sit on them even, i would say based on product make, it would break in about 1-4 years tops or the day you sat on them waka waka. this is all based on the individuals compulsive behavior over time to want to fold them just because or just you happen to be a neat freak & want things put away.to fix this issue i just macgyvered it & taped around the folds to stop folding all together,(taping happened even while i was mid gaming & was even asked if i was taping something lol)because i plan to own them for over 10 years.\n",

      "10180120: Great sound, flimsy construction Cheap plastic on the hinges broke within 6 months. Still a good headset just need to be carefully with it. I still use mine with duct tape... But that said I wish I bought a more premium one and you may wish so too if you go with these.\n",
      "13300906: NOT bluetooth but works well I have to be entirely honest - before buying I thought the &#34;wireless&#34; was bluetooth based and thus would be compatible with any bluetooth enabled device. Sure, my fault, they do not advertise it to be bluetooth, but by saying it is wireless and compatible with devices like iPhone, etc. I kind of implied it. Ok, it works with the iPhone if you plug a (provided) audio p2 cable and it is wireless if you use the (provided) usb dongle. It is still very good so far, sounds great, ear cushions dampen external noise and battery life for the wireless (you don't need to turn it on for wired use) is decent. All in all I think you get what you pay for. It looks nice, it is comfortable, adjustable, good ambient noise reduction (from ear cushions, it does NOT have noise elimination technology).\n",
      "15431548: It's hard to find very many bad things to say about these headphones. It's hard to find very many bad things to say about these headphones. I'll start my saying that I'm a bit of an audiophile... I have a Klipsch surround sound system in my living room, Beats Studio and Klipsch Headphones, Bose system in my car, and the list goes on... I love good sounding audio! I saw these Playstation Gold headphones and decided to try them out. I have other nice headphones like I said, but none of them are wireless. These headphones aren't quite up to the sound quality of my other pairs... the Beats Studios absolutely blow them out of the water, but Beats are also 3 times more expensive, so they had better! The Golds definitely still sound great though! I wish they had just a little more bass/low-end, but the amount they have is sufficient. The 7.1 virtual surround sound (VSS) really impressed me! When they threw in the word &#34;virtual&#34; I was worried that maybe it meant &#34;doesn't actually work&#34; but I was pleasantly surprised. It honestly does seem like surround sound somewhat! The audio is actually very crisp and clear. Like I said, I'm comparing them to headphones that are 3 times more expensive, which I'll admit isn't really fair, but for what these headphones cost they are an awesome value! I also find them to be very comfortable. The earpieces are actually pretty huge compared to other headphones I own. I got my pair used through &#34;Amazon Warehouse&#34; for half of the normal price, and I couldn't be happier with them. They're just an all-around great pair of headphones. I don't see myself ever wanting to get rid of them.  Also a cool feature to note: These headphones have a 1/8&#34; jack on them so that you can plug them in with a cable. They actually work this way even if the headphones are powered off or if the battery is dead. This comes in handy if you forgot to charge them and want to just plug them into the PS4 controller or use them with a different device altogether.\n",

      "42457995: Decent Wireless option for PS4 given limited options Short Story - This is a good wireless option out of the VERY LIMITED wireless options available right now for PS4. I Would rather give it 3.5 stars.It is a good headset but it could be great.Long Story -I am not an audiophile but I have good experience to tell difference between a good and great headphone. I own a Bose QC headset for travel, Steel Series Wired for gaming for PC. In the past I have owned 2 steel series headsets. I have played all kinds of games including competitive Counter Strike, Endgame WOW raiding, LOL, Dark Souls series etc to name very few.So with my experience with gaming and audio, here goes the full review -Pros -1) Sound - 5 starsSound is most important aspect about any headphones and I have to say it is very good or even excellent with these headphones. My experience while playing Destiny literally transformed the instant I put this headset on. I could hear sounds that I never heard before, direction of gun shots, environment sounds that I never noticed, foot steps, just great.The virtual surround sound works as it should and precisely tells you from where the foot steps are coming, what direction bullets were fired from. Very good experience. I have used steel-series 7H before and I can tell that these are as those headphones. Overall great experience as far as sound is concerned.The best thing I like is that I can adjust the sound of game and chat audio, it is a blessing. Trust me, you will find this feature most helpful. You can enjoy the game sound while chatting, best of both worlds.2) Mic - 5 StarsI didn't record any audio but my friends told me I sound well on the mic on the chat and that is enough for me to give it 5 stars.3) Design - 3 starsThis is a hit and miss and for me it is more miss than hit. I like the look of the headphones but personally I really dont care as compared to accessibility of various buttons. I have used these headphones for a week now and still not able to figure out where various buttons are while wearing them. I have to take them off and press button. I will get used to it eventually but they could have done a better job.For example all buttons are &#34;under&#34; the skin of headphone same as when you put a phone cover on headphone and volume buttons bulge out. It isnt bad but it make it hard to find out the buttons as they are not really standing out.Why put all buttons on the same left ear piece, reduce clutter by putting it on right ear piece so that it is also easier to find them.4) Comfort 3 -You will not be able to notice it from the images shown on this product and almost all images on internet and after checking some reviews no one says that these have some weird kind of ear cups. Check out the image that I am attaching with the review. Look at the left cup, do you notice anything strange?The cups are not hollowed completely to give your ears freedom of movement. They are tapered or sloped. And inner surface of cups is hard. Which simply means that if your ears are big you are completely screwed.In the attached image the left cup is not touching the padding due to some camera angle but it is indeed like that. Not sure why they did that, were they trying to save some space and put some stuff there, I don't know but I don't like it. It is uncomfortable.5) Battery life - 5It is fine, no need to worry. We are used to charging our phones so much anyways that charging these couple of times a week wont be an issue. Hey their charge is better than the controller so that's good right :).6) Connectivity with other devices - 2These are not Bluetooth headsets, these are wireless with help of a dongle. Please read the statement again.This means you need to carry a dongle with these as well of you want to connect these with any thing. If the device doesn't have a USB then you cant connectthese wirelessly.This also means your phones can only be connected with a wire rather than wirelessly Guess what does that mean, you will have to carry two headphones for travel 1 wireless for ps4 and other for music in case you only prefer wireless headphones.We live in the world of technological advancement and they couldn't make a freaking Bluetooth headset. What the hell! This is a serious turnoff.So like I said, these are a good wireless option for a PS4 only and I mean this line literally.these wirelessly.This also means your phones can only be connected with a wire rather than wirelessly Guess what does that mean, you will have to carry two headphones for travel 1 wireless for ps4 and other for music in case you only prefer wireless headphones.We live in the world of technological advancement and they couldn't make a freaking Bluetooth headset.

You need to wear the headphones with the mute and controls on the left side of your head. I had this problem at first because being right handed I naturally put the headphones on with the mute button on my right side of the head and people couldn't hear me very well. So I switched the headphones around so the mute button was on my left and now everyone hears me great !!! I know it's strange but I guess the way the Mic is configured that's how they work.

      "1739225: -Pretty good wireless headphones for the price -Pretty good wireless headphones for the price, sound is good but wont satisfy audiophiles.-Easy plug and play on a PS4 and PC. It feels comfortable on the head, but may cause discomfort on hot days as your ears sweat.-Has a built in mic. I've heard mixed reviews about it's quality, but my friends hear me clearly when I Skype, stream, or do online radio.-It may look too big when worn on the head (preference). The design allows for stylish outdoor use in my opinion without looking like some gaudy gaming headset.-The hinges and plastic used for the band are kinda fragile, so be careful not to snap them.-Comes with a bag and removable cable, easy to store and carry around.-Would recommend to anyone looking for affordable wireless headsets for gaming or music.\n",

      "21533873: They WILL break - 4 months later headband broken and plastic fractured. I've had my gold headset (bought the white edition off Ebay cause it looks so good and was sold out in retailers) for no longer than 4 months. Just yesterday the band completely snapped above the left earpiece when taking them off my head. When I looked at the integrity of the plastic on the other (right) side there were already stress fractures present throughout. Make no mistake, the plastic headband on these phones is not sufficiently strong.  I am pretty pissed off at the breakage. These were $150 off ebay and since it wasn't an official retailer I have no receipt and no warranty. I've read that pulse elites had the same problems with cracking plastic in almost exactly the same place. While they look and sound amazing, the gold headphones in general are just bad design. The foldable hinges create a stress point in the plastic just above them because the hinges prevent outward bending. For all of you that have a gold headset it would be good to inspect the plastics integrity along the headband. I'd recommend putting these headphones on in a vertical fashion rather than face-first to reduce lateral stress on the plastic headband.  Very disappointed in a shoddy Sony product that broke within months of regular usage. They performed wonderfully, but the crap plastic used in the headband design breaks easily with repetitive strain such as taking the headphones on and off. These headphones were never dropped and always stored on a headset mount.\n",

      "13086536: Upgrade you headphones All,I have to inform you that I am an average/serious middle age gamer.  If you are on the edge over headphone, let me be clear.  Get these headphones.  They sound great, 7.1 surround sound for $100.00, this is a great deal.  They are light on my head, no wires, all Bluetooth and  battery stays charged for hours.  I am not the headphones expert by far, but if you were looking for some headphones this set will more than do the job!  I do not need the loudest or what someone else deems to be the baddest,, I just need a pair that gives me the best value for my money.  It was easy setup with a YouTube video.  They fold up nice for carryon luggage, NO WIRES, only to charge up the headphones, gives you the option to connect to you controller.  I upgraded from Turtle Beach x4 for xbox.  I was using the x4 headphone with the PS4 provided mic.  It worked for a while, but I needed to upgrade and I am glad that I upgraded to no wires PS4 7.1\n",

      "9918098: I heard you were wanting some new headphones. I had always been within the grey area regarding use of headsets when playing games.  Perhaps I simply didn't like the clunkiness or just preferred using traditional speakers.  These changed my mind.  They're light weight so I often forget that I am wearing anything at all, the voice quality through the hidden microphone is excellent, and the 7.1 surround sound is pretty darn good.  They fold up and fit into the accompanying travel bag.  You can change the volume of the content and the volume of people speaking separately.  This in turn gives great flexibility with audio mixing.  With the Companion app for Playstation 4, you can even alter the equaliser for custom settings or you can use developer settings for games such as The Last of Us, and others.All in all, great set of headphones for just $100!\n",
      "49926121: 100 dollars for a set of slightly below average headphones with built in chat?? These were purchased at a local brick and mortar game store.Everything was as nicely packaged as only a professional packaging engineer could make it.  Out of the box they were pristine and mark free.  The included accessories were individually packaged.  The only complaint that I have about the accessories is that the charging cord is only a few inches long.  It might be 8.  This makes charging while using, um, difficult.  When I charged them, I used a longer mini USB adapter plugged in to a converter that ran directly from an outlet strip.The headphones work as they should - the mute button mutes the conversation in game.  People can hear you with no problem without a visible mic.  They are somewhat comfortable, but not the best.  When adjusted for fit over my ears, after about 4 hours of gaming, I could feel the weight on the top of my head.  I expect to feel something on my temples, as I wear glasses, and there was pressure there, too.  Perhaps it could be argued that I wore them too long, but I've had other sets of heavy headphones that don't hurt the top of my head after extended listening.I downloaded the driver for the PS4 and loaded up the Destiny mini-program for the phones.  I played this for a number of hours, then switched the program to one called &#34;shooter,&#34; (or something like that) Sony's program for any shooting game.  The tweaks programmed specifically for Destiny were somewhat better than the general shooter program.  Kudos for making a product that can have different sound sets for different sources.  It isn't a replacement for a decent amp with an equalizer to tap in to, but it's OK.  And - there was no &#34;wireless hiss.&#34;  This isn't a RF device, so interference isn't a problem.At the end of the evening, these were hooked up to my phone, a HTC One M8, via the supplied cord to watch a few shows.  At first, the phone didn't recognize the headphones as present and continued playing through the speakers.  I reset the cord to ensure that there wasn't a PEBCAK going on - and they hooked up fine.  Bear in mind I did switch the headset back to a standard mode - no eq settings from the PS4 - to see how these sounded without any preset bend in the source material. I also tried it with a few of the other presets - bass boost, treble, etc.OK, so the sound.  I was generally disappointed.  The chat was clear and understandable both ways, sending and receiving.  The volume controls on the side of the set worked.  There was a small difference in soundstage when the virtual surround was on and off.  The set, however, failed to deliver an &#34;end user&#34; bass response, mid range was over represented, and the highs were somewhat lacking, too.I've got a lot of headphones laying around the house to compare these to, ranging from 5 dollar earbuds to a set of AKG K270s.  I certainly don't expect these to sound like the AKGs, or my venerable Tritton AX360.  But these don't sound like they cost a hundred bucks.  I've got a set of 40 dollar Sony run-of-the-mill phones that not only stand up to the Gold Wireless Headset, but deliver better sound stage, detail, and frequency response.I'm not sure how these can be sold for 100 dollars.  If they were 50, then I'd be OK with them - even with the slightly below average sound quality - as a chat headphone when I game online.  As a general purpose set of phones (as they must be intended as the app on the PS4 has settings for different sources), these are average, and not worth this much money.  Quite frankly, the Sony brand Vita earbuds have better sound (although they are far from &#34;perfect,&#34; too - and they cost 10 dollars on Amazon.  I was looking for a replacement for my AX360s as they are getting quite worn.  These, however, aren't going to be the ones that foot the bill.\n",

      "16790294: Could be great For something that is made by Sony for a Sony product. It sure is a finky piece of equipment. With included instructions that are a joke. It work for all of 5 mins after it was charged. My son tells me there is not chatting or sound.  These are the instructions it should have included  &#34;To Reset the headset!If the headset does not respond when you try to operate it, perform the following actions to reset it::Connect the wireless adapter to a PlayStation system or other powered USB port.Insert a small pin or similar object into the hole surrounding the reset button in the wireless adapter, and push in for at least one second.On the headset, hold down the MUTE button and the VSS button.While still holding down the MUTE button and the VSS button, slide the power switch to position 1 or 2.&#34;I found that using a Usb cable to plug it in initially works to get the paring started. Like I said something that is made for a product that they sell. You would think that it would be much more straight forward. But nope. Unlike other Bluetooth devices, most Sony headsets are paired exclusively with the USB dongles that ship with them. WHY!? Bad business Sony!When you do get it up and running they are great. I really like that you can run the TV sound through the Headset.\n",

      "49528654: These headphones are great and will be a game changer for your relationships These headphones are great and will be a game changer for your relationships. No more waking up the girlfriend, wife, baby, etc. with late night gaming or movie watching. No more struggling to hear what the protagonist just said at that vital moment. Enjoy full sound with all your media and bother no one!The sound is great with the PS3 and PC. Very easy to install on both devices. The PS3 has a companion app, which you should download (it's free). The app has a bunch of preset sound mixes that you can use depending on what you are watching or playing. Even has setups tailor made for specific games (I've been using the Last of Us setting and it really brings the game to life). You can also customize your own settings. I think the sound quality is great. Dialogue is very clear, surround sound is very engaging, and the highs and lows are pretty decent.  I've never used super expensive headsets but I think you're getting a very good value for you money with these and they couldn't easier to setup and enjoy. Microphone works great too. Get a set and never worry about waking the baby again!\n",

Make sure you read up on how to get the most out of it or else you will be missing a good bit of the magic, so to speak.  It has voice feedback (2 different feedback levels) and virtual surround sound (both turned off by default), and you really should download the companion app on the PS4 (or PS3), for free, to get the ability for special game specific sound maps (or to create your own sound map).  Another plus is that it connects via a USB dongle, so you never actually need to pair the headset to the system.  Just plug in the USB and turn on the headset and it will pair automatically for you.  It does work with PCs as well.\n",

So when looking for a new one I trusted the Sony Brand and saw that the newer Gold headset looked to have similar &#34;cans&#34;. These are just as comfortable. I wear glasses and these fit over glasses and ears perfectly.Primary use is for gaming (COD) and watching movies. Sound quality is excellent for both.\n",
      "44182815: I was worried that this headset would not be as good as my old pair After owning the older PlayStation Plus headset for a few years, I was worried that this headset would not be as good as my old pair.  Fortunately, they are much better.  I will say that the Pulse headset had softer, squishier ear pads, but the Gold headset fits better over the ears.  I'm also very happy that the Gold headset has retained all the features of the Pulse headset such as voice chat/in-game sound balance rocker, mic mute button, and the 3.5mm headset jack for other uses.  I will also say that the battery life is significantly improved over the Pulse headset.  The Gold headset also uses a micro-USB port for charging (like the PS4 controllers do) instead of the regular USB port (like the PS3 controllers use) to make it more compatible with the PS4, but the Gold headset is just as compatible with the PS3 system.Only major downside I can think of is that the headset still uses a USB dongle to work with the system instead of Bluetooth.  The USB dongle has the added benefit of working with computers and the like, but it takes up a valuable USB port on my PS3/PS4 now that the systems only have 2 USB ports (unlike my first PS3).Overall, I certainly recommend this headset, especially for the price.  For good audio quality, PlayStation integration, and solid build quality, it's hard to beat this deal.\n",

      "26323030: Perfect for my Needs.  Perfect Price! Great sound for the price.  Can use 3.5 mm cord to plug into other devices.  For that I recommend this product: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWR8OZ4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Sound: Sound is great - charge is decent, can use and charge at the same time if you have long enough USB cable. The sound is on par with $167 wired headphones I purchased a few years ago.  The mic on this product is not good but to me it is not an issue as I don't do much online gaming, I just like to immerse myself in high quality campaigns such as Far Cry 4, GTA, and Telltale Episodic Adventures.  These headphone as prefect for these needs.Set-up: PS4 setup is simple.  PS3 may require an update. Either way the only downside is that the wireless receiver takes up a USB port which is difficult if you only have 2 front ports. Pretty simple though, turn the headphones on, and PlayStation recognizes and automatically switches to them for audio. no need to alter settings like I had to do with other gaming phones.Design: Comfortable, can wear all day with out issue.  However, they are ulgy, ulgy, ulgy.  To me I don't care if I look like a drunken Mickey Mouse wearing them - others might - but i am ok with sacrificing aesthetics for comfort and function.\n",

      "52513804: A solid headset with one definite flaw you should be aware of I owned a pair of these for about a year after they first came out, and I got a lot of use out of them. What I've found is they're quite comfortable for extended play once you \\\\\"break them in\\\\\" as they can be a little stiff and tight out of the box depending on the size of your head. For reference, I'd wear a 7 3/8 if I was buying a fitted cap, which is about a 23-inch circumference around the head.    That \\\\\"breaking in\\\\\" stage can and probably will eventually lead to these headphones breaking, because just above the spot where they're designed to fold in, there is a weak spot in the plastic and after dozens (perhaps even a few hundred) times putting them on and off, I experienced a problem where the plastic got so weak on one side that it suddenly snapped.    However, everything else about this headset is excellent, if you can look past what is probably a design flaw. As mentioned, they can be worn comfortably for hours at a time, and I can go a good six hours or so before needing to plug them in to recharge. Note that you may wish to buy a secondary USB plugin in case you want or need to wear these while charging. The cable that comes in the box is maybe a foot long and clearly just designed to plug into the console to charge while you're not wearing them. Sometimes I had to get into a somewhat awkward position with that cord plugged into my laptop, so when I bought a second headset to replace my first one, I also got a longer cord.    After mulling over my options, I decided to go with another one of these because I was satisfied enough with the first one. Audio sounds excellent, I'm told I sound very clear through the mic, and the added feature of being able to install specific audio settings designed for certain games is a nice, if not entirely necessary, perk.    One thing I did have to get a little used to is one of the sets of buttons on the headset is what controls the audio-to-voice balance in the speakers. It wasn't a big deal for me until I used the mic forparty chat or multiplayer games, and you can't adjust that setting through the console menu (PS4). It's simply done through a set of buttons on one side, which is convenient enough and probably explained in the manual (it's been a while since I read it).    Overall I find this to be a very good headset with a reasonable price that puts it in what I'd consider a midrange level for gaming headsets. The features are good, the headset feels good, and the only thing you really have to beware of is the probability that they'll likely break at some point. Again, for me it was a year. For others it may be more or less, but if you like these enough I suppose another $100 won't be the end of the world.    There is a 1-year warranty that should cover replacement if this breaks before that time is up.\n",

      "6548276: Pretty Good! If... I has these a while back. And I got to say for being under $100, you get what you pay for. And that's not bad at all. This headset is wireless on PS3/PS4/PC using a USB Dongle. Just plug it into a USB port and it should work. I do have to say that it is very comfortable. Not the best headset in terms of comfort. But you could where these for a solid 3-4 hours without your ears hurting. I do like the virtual Surround Sound, it's nice that you can turn it on and off at a touch of a button. I wouldn't use the VSS in games like COD where your trying to hear for footsteps, it's not good for that. Only use the surround Sound in really intense action games like Battlefield or Far Cry, stuff like that. I like the volume controls on the headset, very easy to get use to. The one problem with this headset, is the microphone. So god awful, don't get this headset for the mic. If your looking for a headset and want good sound and a great microphone, go for the Plantronics RIG Headset. But if you wan't a headset that is wireless, has VSS and you don't care about the mic. This is perfect for you!PROS: - Comfortable- Stereo and Virtual Surround Sound- Wireless (Battery last a while)- Big Earcups- MP3 OptionCONS: - MICROPHONE is GARBAGE (DON'T GET THIS FOR THE MIC)- Not the most durable headset (But it's fine it you don't sit/step on it or throw it:)\n",

      "10161065: old reliable - it works how you need it to and it does a good job I tried out so many headsets. I wanted something I could use with PS4 and PC. I wanted a decent microphone. I wanted good sound quality. I like bass. I preferred wireless. No other headset checked as many boxes as well as this one did. Seriously... if it's on Amazon and it's considered a headset - it didn't stack up - I tried many.Mic: 4/5Speakers: 4/5Features: 4/5Battery Life: 4/5Price: 5/5 (I paid $80, but I'd pay more)Value: unbeatableThe mic is very good. It's boomless but it'll pick up my whispers. The downside is that it doesn't pick up the whole essence of your voice. You can't have a Skype conversation and expect the other person to hear the bass in your voice - I've been told that I sound a bit &#34;canny&#34; on Skype - like I'm on a speakerphone. However, for a GAMING headset, the mic does what it needs to do and you'll have no problem getting people to hear you. If you want to seduce someone, get different mic. If you want to talk to someone, this will do the job well.The speakers are sweet. There is a bass boost setting and a standard setting. The bass boost setting can actually be altered with the headset companion app for PS4 where you can make any equalizer you want or use a preset from Sony... (cool feature). The speakers do not have the most bass of all the headsets out there, but they certainly make the cut. They won't rattle your brain but they should satisfy the need to feel the boom of a gunshot or music full of bass (using them for music right now). The sound seems to lack a certain crystal clearness some other headsets had - not sure if it's the wireless or something else. It's almost like the bitrate is lower - but we're talking the difference between like 320kbps MP3 and FLAC... it's barely noticeable, nevermind bothersome. Great sound.7.1 simulated surround sound. Differential volume control for chat vs game for PS4. Custom equalizers. Mute button. Wireless! The differential sound control for chat vs. game is a feature I only found on this headset. In-game chat applies, you don't need to be in a party. Adjust the volume and drown out the game or drown out your friends. It's great. Surround sound is cool. Equalizer settings are cool. Mute is common but it's easy to use - just a button. They also have an auxiliary jack so if you just want to plug them into a device (like your phone!) and play sound (without wireless) you can! In short, more features than your Toyota.Wireless means batteries... The battery will outlast your PS4 controller! You can charge them while you use them. I think they're rated for something like 8 hours. The battery life is solid, but I'm sure there's something better out there in the way of battery life. However, this is all I need!At $80 (when I bought it), this beat out headsets over $179 like the Sennheiser G4ME ONE and Skullcandy PLYR1 7.1 Surround Wireless blah blah. The G4ME ONE is amazing as well, but it's wired. The microphone is quality - you could use it for a podcast (and I almost kept it for that purpose). The Skullcandy was uncomfortable and felt cheap. It worked well enough but it wasn't my favorite. I tried other headsets that were wired and intended for PC... I could go on. Basically you can spend more or less for a headset, but if the things that matter to you resemble my list (at the top) and this headset is not outside your price range, get it and you won't be disappointed.Overall, this headset found a place in my heart.

Everyone knows what sound-blocking headphones do to your voice, so these headphones desperately need a monitor in them so you can hear your voice level.-Sometimes, during loud parts in the game, you try to talk to your buddy, but you can't hear yourself... because there is no monitor in the headset.-If you want to plug in an audio device (let's say you want to listen to your iPod while you play a game), it's not happening.  Headset shuts off sound from the Playstation and plays only from audio device.  (this is a feature I found on a $45 PS3 headset)-Charging cord is extremely short, maybe 5 inches in length.  So I don't suggest charging while playing.Conclusion:  I recommend this headset because I think it holds a lot of value for $100.  Once/If you get over the lack of hearing your voice in the headset, it isn't that bad.\n",

      "30859235: Enhances Gaming so much! I absolutely love playing games on the PS4 with these on. I was hearing things in Shadow of Mordor I never had before. It's very immersive.The Wireless aspect is fantastic, especially for gamers who have large HDTVs and sit farther away from the console. As a bonus, I use them at work by connecting the usb dongle to my Mac laptop. They aren't nearly as cool looking as the wireless Beats headphones everyone loves, but they were hundreds of dollars cheaper.The sound quality and bass is really good, but I'm no audiophile and haven't ever experienced  the higher end Wireless headsets out there.Anyway, I'm stoked on these. They make gaming better at a reasonable price.\n",

      "33410152: Great headset for use with the PS4 - tons of hours spent with these on and they still look like new! This headset is great.  It definitely doesn't work how I had thought it would when I originally purchased it - but man it's seen a lot of use over the last 15 months and it's going strong.I changed the use of this headset after the first week I got it - I had thought that I would use it without wires originally.  After a couple of days using it and recharging it - I finally just plugged it in to my controller and haven't had to charge it since.There aren't as many controls on this headset as some of the more fancy ones out there - but this works great for me and it's holding up fantastic as well.  I haven't had any problems with it and I have probably racked up well over a thousand hours with this thing on my head playing games or using it in some fashion or another since I got it.The noise cancelling is great, the surround sound is perfect for me - definitely a huge boost with hearing enemies coming up behind you or should I say - trying to sneak up behind you.Hopefully they make some improvements to these with the controls and tweaks that individuals can make - but for now - these are working great for me.\n",

I've never found another brand that makes the angled ear pads to fit people wearing glasses so well, but Sony does it right. They last many hours on a single charge, the microphone works great.I have noticed every once in a while (it's only happened twice since I bought them) that they get this weird double feedback going on that makes the right and left ears sound off from each other. I just turn it off and on again and it's fixed. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.Love it!\n",

My turtle beachs made my ears hurt (the cups were too small). These golds on the other hand can be adjusted. They're wireless when used with a PS3, PS4, and laptop computer. Easily worth the money. If you want the best sound and the best overall deal in the $100 price range, I highly, highly recommend these.\n",

After spending many hours searching for answers online and talking to Sony on the phone, it's obvious there is a common manufacturing defect that they are simply ignoring which prevents it from functioning with the PS4. It still works with PS3 and everything else, and they sound excellent and are super comfortable, but I bought it for the PS4. A product that does not function as advertised gets 1 star (0 if I could).\n",
      "48035772: DO NOT BUY GARBAGE! Pure garbage. It cracked on both sides right above the hinges. Very cheap plastic. I lost the receipt and they are only 3 months old now I can't return them. Very poor product and customer service by Sony.\n",

      "17481726: Sony's Gold Headset Delivers Big Audio at a Small(ish) Price With the last generation of consoles (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii) came a torrent of gaming headsets and it appears that this generation will be no different. Thankfully we're finally getting some first-party support on the PS4 and the Sony &#34;Gold&#34; Wireless Headset is a pretty fantastic headset.--------------------DESCRIPTION:--------------------The Gold Wireless Headset (GWH from here on) is a modern, sleek headset with some very nice touches for a moderately priced headset. Yes, a $100 headset (as of this writing) is considered a moderately priced headset. First, you're of course getting a truly wireless experience. This is an important distinction because there are &#34;wireless&#34; headsets out there that aren't completely wireless (e.g. Turtle Beach XO Seven) and do have at least one wire leading to a controller port.There are two primary components to this headset. The actual headset and the USB dongle that plugs directly into the PS4 or PS3. The dongle looks exactly like any USB storage drive that you've likely been using for years and the matte-black plastic matches that used in the PS4's chassis.The actual headset is pretty nifty looking and as I mentioned very modern and sleek. The primary distinction here is that the headband on the GWH is totally stationary and the actual earpieces move up and down along the headband to accommodate large or smaller shaped heads. The headband is made from strong yet flexible plastic and gives plenty of play. Unlike some of my more expensive headsets I've tried the GWH has never given me a headache or discomfort to my head or ears. So take that as a mark of a well designed headset.The earpieces are large and feature plenty of cushioning.  Physical buttons coated in rubberized plastic on the left earpiece control all function on the headset. These functions are:♦ Volume +/-♦ Mute on/off♦ Sound/chat volume +/-♦ VSS or Virtual Surround Sound on/offAdditionally the left earpiece has a standard 3.5mm auxiliary input jack for connecting compatible music players.--------------------USE:--------------------Despite looking pretty bulky this is a very light headset. I'm not sure the exact weight but I'd estimate about .5lbs. The other thing I noticed right away when using this headset is that placing the physical buttons on the earpiece means that you'll have to commit the location of each to memory. Until you're familiar enough with the headset you'll have to remove the headset to find the appropriate button. It's a bit annoying at first but quickly enough overcome.Sound quality is surprisingly good. Sounds are crisp and clear; and this headset can get quite loud. Loud enough in fact to cause me discomfort. I played several games with this headset that I'd already played using my TV speakers and the difference is incredible. Sound, maybe more than any other feature, serves to really immerse you in the game you're playing or movie you're watching. So if you're on the fence about getting a good quality headset, take it from me - it makes a huge difference and it's well worth the purchase. Sound queues that get muddled through regular TV speakers are pronounced here.The GWH features a built-in mic; which simply means there's no visible mic or mic boom. Again, sound quality is really good. My online friends noticed and immediate difference with this headset in the clarity of my chat audio. Feedback is pretty much nonexistent. Chat audio piping through the headset can be adjusted separately from the in-game audio which is terrific and you can customize the setting based on your own preference.Another huge bonus of going with Sony's own headset is the accompanying PSN Store application called the Headset Companion App. You can download this directly to your console and modify a variety of settings. Developers can create theirown sound profiles for their games and make them available to folks with the app and headset. Pretty cool and definitely worth checking out!--------------------THE HIGHS:--------------------(+) Audio. Sound quality is very good especially if you're new to headsets. While the GWH won't run with the bigger more expensive headsets out there this is a very good set for the money.(+) VSS. Virtual Surround Sound delivers Dolby-like surround without the expense of a 7.1 headset.(+) Chat. I love that there's no mic boom and that chat quality is both very good and separately adjustable from in-game audio.(+) Design. Sleek, modern, and styled in the old school PS2 color scheme. This is a good looking headset.(+) Compatibility. Quickly swap this between your PS4 and PS3 by moving the USB adapter between consoles. Easy!(+) Music. The addition of a 3.5mm jack on the left earpiece means you can plug up to a smartphone or tablet for listening to music!(+) PS Bag. Sony threw in a PlayStation branded carrying bag.--------------------THE LOWS:--------------------(-) Bluetooth. More specifically the lack of Bluetooth calling support.(-) Charging cable. The included charging cable is maybe 5-inches long making charging somewhat awkward. Thankfully any USB to micro-USB cable will work so you likely have one laying around.(-) Wireless music. Unfortunately the decision to place the 3.5mm auxiliary jack on the headset and not directly on the USB dongle means that you won't be able to listen to music wirelessly. Look to the Pulse Elite headset if you're after this feature.(-) Price. As of this review the Pulse Elite is about $.20 more than the GWH. Seriously.

      "1212096: so much more than a gaming headset! can't beat all the functions for the price! up to par for everything i needed it for and then sum. everything right at your finger tips. from muting your audio, adjusting your volume, and adjusting chat over game (and vice verso) audio levels. the Headset companion App on my on my PS4 is a plus and the hidden mic makes you not look like your flying a jet. recommend to anyone with a PS4, laptop, or phone. i use it with all 3.\n",
      "41787360: Thumbs up! My son loved this so much. It fits very nicely. The sound is very clear and can be adjusted according to the game. The built in microphone is a huge plus.\n",

      "48055748: Comparing to the Sony PS3 7.1 headphones These headphones are worth the premium and are an upgrade to the previous version for the PS3 in that it has a better battery life and smoother appearance as well as now having the option to fold and store in a provided pouch.The only way it didn't match or surpass the previous version in my experience is that I can chat walking all around the house with the PS3 headset and it doesn't cut out; not true for the PS4 version which leads me to believe the signal is weaker.I could test the PS3 headset on the PS4, but not the PS4 headset on the PS3, so no real conclusive tests other than that.\n",
      "28284273: Great for wireless gaming on console and PC, as well as wired mobile use for calls. Great headset for wireless gaming. The voice clarity is amazing compared to the PS4's pack-in headset, and the faux surround sound is very impressive for the price you're paying. It's not going to compete with the top of the line bluetooth/7.1 surround/chat phones, but at the $75 when it's on sale, it's well worth it. Like most Sony products, you are paying a bit extra for the brand recognition, but also as per usual for Sony- this was money well spent. You just shouldn't have to shell out $75-$125 for a decent 1st-party chat solution for the PS4, but that's another topic altogether.I game on a big home theater normally, and it's just too loud late at night. These headphones have made it so I don't have to compromise on volume/surround sound immersion when trying to respect my surroundings.They also function admirably as a surround sound replacement while gaming online with friends. There are built in controls to adjust the audio mix between game and chat audio, as well as options built into the PS4 to tweak things a bit. There is an App on PSN that allows you to load custom audio profiles onto the headset, specific to certain games, or to program your own. The basic wireless functionality of this device is compatible with the PS3, but I cannot say if the custom audio profiles work on both platforms. I would assume that they do as the profile information is saved to the headphones themselves, not the console...It is worth noting that while this is a bluetooth-enabled headset, it requires a USB dongle to connect- so no pairing it to your phone. Works great on my PC with dongle attached as well. That said, these phones will work and support voice calls via a traditional wired audio jack, it just won't work as wireless headphones on the go, which wasn't what I purchased them for anyway.They are light and a bit clunky to wear out anyway, and the removable plates on the plastic frame over the cups fall off too easily, but they are replaceable and Sony sells a few options if you want to customize the look a little bit.These phones are great, when you keep your expectations within the realm of the price range you are shopping in.\n",

      "33983960: Much Better than Turtle Beach Headsets This review is going to be short and sweet.  I've previously owned two Turtle beach headsets, one for PS3 and I received one for Xmas for my PS4.  I'm pretty comfortable setting up most equipment and fairly decent with electronics and I still can't understand why the Turtle Beach headsets are so complicated to set up.  I finally gave up on the PS4 version and decided to give the Sony headset a try.  It was 1,000x more easier to set up and took me about 2 minutes.  The instructions were clear, straightforward and easy to read.  This was a difference of night and day for me as I've found the Turtle Beach headset instructions extremely confusing, and the setup process always seemed extremely onerous and overly complicated.  I've been pleased with the performance of this headset.  I'm not too picky about sound quality so this review won't deal with that.  I can't tell a difference between the sound quality on these vs. the Turtle Beach PX4, but I'm not an expert.  I just loved these due to their simplicity and the ease of setup.  An added bonus is the built in microphone which is a stark contrast to the giant turtle beach microphone that makes me feel like a telemarketer or helicopter pilot sitting on my couch.  Well done Sony.\n",

      "41458574: Plastic hinges RMA experience and poor mic quality Please... do yourself a favor and look at a different headset.  The sound is amazing for the price, but I've had my friends tell me I sound horrible with the mic and with almost everyday use for 4 months with care, the plastic hinges cracked and broke.  The first Sony rep I talked to wouldn't give me an RMA number because they said the service center wouldn't accept physical damage.  The second rep I talked to managed to give me an RMA number. All I paid for was shipping my bad headset to them.  I sent it last week and received a new pair from Sony just a couple of days ago. I'm glad I got it under warranty, but I have a bad feeling they will eventually crack and break again.\n",
      "40311828: Very disappointed in my purchase After 6 month's of casual use, the plastic holding in the hinges broke. Clearly it is a design flaw, over time that little piece of thin plastic will wear down and break.  Sony told me, it was not covered under warranty.  Very disappointed in my purchase, certainly not worth the 99$ i paid.\n",

      "23088537: Very good headset for the price Very good headset for the price. I have also Astro a40, and it is much much louder and not to mention 99$ for a wireless headset that sounds great is a steal. Forgot to mention, it's completely wireless, no wire to the controller nothing!\n",
      "47232164: Pretty good headset for price I have these headphones for about a month now. I love using them. They are much bigger than originally anticipated but nothing over the top. Before these I had Turtle Beach Black Ops II Tango headphones and they were bigger so this was something more to my size (ps. i have a smaller than normal head size). AnwaysPros:- I love that it gives you battery life indication on the ps4.- Fits comfortable on my head and cushions are very comfortable.- You can customize the configuration of sound levels depending on type of games you play although there are only 2 options, 1 is standard, 2 is your custom configuration. I wish there was at least another option because to change it you have to into an app on the ps4 which will require you to quit any game. We play more than one type of game so its kind of dumb there is only 1 configuration. But I digress.Cons:- My 1 only con and reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that my wireless adapter for some reason or another will cut off and come back on so I will loss complete sound for about a second. Sometimes it happens often, other times it doesn't. I've tried taking off the adapter and turning off the headset and trying again. I've only been able to use it a few times and haven't experimented with it yet to figure out why it does this but for now it seems that it doesn't depend on battery levels as it does it when its fully charged and I don't think I'm sitting too far but this I have to confirm. I sit about 10-15 feet away from my tv. Will update once I figure it out.\n",
      "44081600: So awesome I absolutely love these things. Sound quality is very good, not spectacular but very good. I find them to be very comfortable and the fact that theres no visible microphone makes them a little more appealing, atleast to me. I have friends with these and they sound great, nice and clear. The different sound profiles may seem a little unnecessary to some but they are actually very cool. I played most of infamous second son using the custom sound profile and it was sweet. If you enjoy first person shooters the virtual surround sound is something you would probably enjoy. It makes everything so much more intense. Also the bass is very solid, even when just using the regular audio jack for an ipod, etc. I use these alot as just regular headphones and i really enjoy them. And most importantly is the price. Considering the versatility of these headphones and the quality of them, id argue $100 is a steal.\n",
      "5557237: Worth the price!! totally worth the money!!The battery does run out after about 8 or 9 hours of play... but if you forget to charge it, it's not a big deal, since you can buy a long mini usb cable  and plug it in while you play.The mini usb it comes with is so short... you almost HAVE to buy a longer cable to go with it. However, it's totally worth it.The sound quality is amazing, and the integrated mic works perfectly. The ear muffs are adjustable, which is good because I have a small head.Love love love! Totally recommend it!\n",

The ear cups are moderately sized and so often when I slide them on quickly they hurt my ears and I must slide them around my ears to get them comfortable to not cause my ears to get long-term pain and end up swollen... and I have the ears of a teen and 3. The material on the cups tear very easily due to wear and tear. Otherwise the headphones have met my expectations.\n",

      "18561157: Great if you use it for chat-only I have owned this Playstation Gold Wireless Headset for a couple of days and find I have to return it.  For me, I like to play all the audio through the headset and find the battery life to be insufficient for my needs.  Also, I had to wear headset with the controls on the left, I found that my friends could barely hear me for some reason when I wore this headset with controls on the right.  Coming from a Turtle Beach headset, I favor having the controls on the right.  I also prefer nearly 15 hours of gameplay between charging and find the sound quality of the Playstation headset to be somewhat lower than TB as well with hardly any bass if at all.  Sadly I will be returning the headset because I do find them a little more comfortable in wear for long usage and do like the actual design of this Playstation headset better.  Alas, it all comes down to performance for me.\n",
      "49478825: Works great! He says it is very comfortable I bought this for my husband so I didn't have to constantly hear all the crazy noises from his PS4 game, Destiny. Works great! He says it is very comfortable, blocks out all outside noises (like me) and puts out clear quality sound from the game. Now all I hear from the game is his voice in the other room talking to his fellow online gamers. I highly recommend it to all girlfriends, wives and moms that live with a gamer.\n",
      "27350122: I'm nearly speechless over how much a headset has upped my gaming. I have a Sony 5.1 Surround Sound System (1000watts RMS+250watts for 12&#34; Sub).  I got these because I just wanted to not piss off my college roommates (4 of us are renting a nice apartment but the walls are kinda thin).  First, I've never been into playing FPS's online before, it's kind of monotonous.  Anyway, recently I got Destiny, and the day I got these they SERIOUSLY upped my game.  If I don't use these now my kills go down about 25% and I die about 33% more (These numbers are extrapolated from 24 all for one games in the crucible. I would play once with and the next without, and then with... I did this until I had my stats for a dozen games with and a dozen games without.  Be careful, there are some name brand over the ear headsets which are less than half of the price of these, but they are not true 7.1 surround sound inside each ear cup.  By using 7 directional speakers and one &#34;center&#34; speaker for dialogue they've done what I thought was impossible and made a TRUE 7.1 surround WIRELESS headset.  I almost bought a different pair for 50 bucks, boy am I glad I didn't.\n",

This is the only product that I have ever bought that I feel I have to leave a negative review, they are THAT bad. These are the worst headphones I have ever had. They were great headphones until the stupid plastic pieces broke. The hinges which take the most stress are made of cheap plastic, the most integral part of the headphones are prone to break. DO NOT BUY. WASTE OF MONEY. My $100 headphones are sitting here in pieces unusable because the plastic hinges broke. Look it up on Google. This is a common problem.

You must push the headphones back or forward so that your ears are in the deeper part of the channel; they are angled so they they open up more towards the rear.  Not as comfortable as my Turtle Beach X11's though, but good enough.\n",

Less than a month the plastic started cracking because of the folding earbuds which I avoided doing.The plastic cracked everywhere but its still functional but had to tape it to use it. Avoid this like a plague or you will waste money on this cheap headphones when this happens to you. I will never buy a sony headphone in my life.

I love how the microphone is built in and not protruding into your face and I love that they're 100% wireless while gaming.But they are uncomfortable and hurt my ears after only 2 or 3 hours of gaming and they are sensitive to outside noises. People in my chat can hear everything going on even though I have the mic sensitivity turned all the way down. My friends Also, there's no way to adjust the volume difference between in-game sound and chat sounds so loud parts of the game drown out the voices. Finally, the sidetone feature does not work at all. Noise canceling headphones with no side tone means you basically have to yell to hear yourself, especially during loud parts of games.Overall, it's a good VSS headset for the price, especially if chatting isn't your primary use. I'd recommend and would purchase again.\n",

At max volume with app add-on this headset only produced enough sound to know that people were around me in the various FPS games I play. My turtle beach X11s allowed me to locate my adversaries with the utmost ease by defining out the sounds of what exactly the individuals were walking on. The turtle beaches just make every game and movie sound better. I had to return these because they simply did not provide the sound quality a video game enthusiast like me requires.

      "35057250: Very good so far I bought these to replace my beloved Turtle Beach headset, which was wired. I have been wanting a wireless set of headphones for a while now and looked for some that I could be happy with. The ones that I found within my budget still had to be wired to my PS4 controller. I debated over getting these because of some reviews that I have read stated that the quality of the headphone construction was cheap and break easily. I finally took the plunge and purchased this for Amazon a couple of weeks ago and so for here are my thoughts.Pros:Great crystal clear soundTotally wirelessMic works great (as I have been told by people that I talk to online)Price was great. ( caught them on sale )Battery life is good by not great.Companion app is very useful.Wireless range is very good.Comfortable to wear. ( I wear glasses and they don't hurt my ears )Cons;Very short recharge cable ( although you can use just about any charge cable )Battery life good but not great. ( I play a lot, sometimes 20 hrs. straight and have to charge them regularly )The lack of a good sidetone. ( where you can hear your own voice when speaking )That's all the pros and cons that I can think of at the moment, I will update this as time goes on and I have more time of use with them.In conclusion;These are a great buy for those that want a good set of totally wireless headphones at a very good price. I highly recommend this to those of you looking for a good, cheap pair of headphone for your PS4's.\n",

The Gold headset is so much better than a $50 increase.  These are very comfortable with or without my glasses.  I was expecting decent sound from these but once you mess around with the Companion App available on PS3 or PS4 store you can get some amazing results.  The biggest shock was when I plugged them into my phone.  Music and videos on these things from the 3.5mm jack are simply amazing and blow away some other music headsets that cost near the $300 mark.  Hands down the best headset for $99 and in the top 5 from $149 to $399.\n",

      "42549535: Microphone sucks, sound is great! The surround sound on these things is actually really impressive. The charge lasts around four hours.Unfortunately, there's no power-saving feature on these, so if you forget to turn them off when you're done, you'll come back to a dead pair of headphones and you'll need to turn them OFF and plug them in for a little while before you can use them again.They won't really build up a charge from the USB cable while they're running, so expect to have to turn them off to bring them back to full power.The microphone is, unfortunately, pretty awful, but that's not *really* why you're buying these, right?Also note that while these are NOT bluetooth compatible, the included USB adapter can be plugged into just about anything (haven't tried it on my Linux boxes, but...) and you'll get audio and mic working with minimal/no driver issues.\n",

I've probably been using the wired headset for a couple of years now, I'd like to say around the time that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 came out. Haven't really had a use for a headset other than Call of Duty but when I bought Destiny, there were no real ways of communicating with my team and the default emotes in Destiny are hardly useful. I plugged in my old Turtle Beach headset and found that the wires were just a nuisance I could no longer go with anymore.    I went ahead and picked up this PlayStation Gold Wireless Stereo Headset. I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality of the headset and while this isn't the highest level model that Sony makes, I found this one more than sufficient enough to play games with. The sound quality is great and the ear cushions are comfortable. The microphone is built into the headset so nothing sticks out which makes it look very sleek. I had no problems with any disconnections with the supplied dongle (plugged into the PS4 usb port). Battery life is pretty good, I've only had to charge it about once a week or so and that was with some daily lengthy Destiny playthroughs (3-4 hours a day at one time). Solid wireless headset!\n",

      "33275412: The better pick over the wired model.  Almost perfect Just having bought a PS4, I wanted a way in which I could play early in the morning or late at night without disturbing anyone.I was torn between getting the wired PS4 headset or spending almost twice as much for the wireless.  Glad I spent the $100 and went full tilt.These headphones pretty much do the trick, though with some downsides...First, the documentation Sony provides is almost useless.  Sure, it tells you how to quickly set up these headsets with the bluetooth dongle.  The PS4 does instantly recognize the headset connection.  However, you'll be wondering for quite awhile why no audio is being piped through the headset.  The reason being -- and Sony doesn't make mention of this in its instructions -- is that you have to go into the PS4 audio settings and change the output to the headphones.The headphones sound...okay.  There is a lack of low lend, but it does not sound &#34;tinny.&#34;  Even with the PS4 headphone app installed, I found very little difference in the quality of the audio both in &#34;shooter&#34; and &#34;custom&#34; mode.  Yes, I did have the headphone in position &#34;2&#34; which is where your customized sounds will show up.While there is a sense of direction wearing these headphones, it is nowhere as good as listening with a 7.1 stereo setup.  However, I doubt most people have the kind of 5.1 or 7.1 system that audiophiles have, so I am certain these headphones will sound remarkable to those with a lesser setup.The headphones are comfortable.  The padding does make your ears warm.  In the summer, I could see there being perspiration issues wearing the heavy pads.  However, the fit is perfect for my normal sized head and it manages to keep outside noise at bay.Been getting over 5 hours of use with these headphones without charging.The microphone is the one aspect I have not tested yet simply because I have not been in any online games.  From what I understand, it's not the best microphone in the world, and is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of this wireless version compared to the wired which has a boom mic.In all, I really like these headphones.  However, don't kid yourself into believing that for $100 you are going to get incredible-sounding audio out of these things.  The audio sounds pretty damn good, but any audiophile could immediately tell you that these headphones are not on par with the best ones that are out there.at I understand, it's not the best microphone in the world, and is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of this wireless version compared to the wired which has a boom mic.In all, I really like these headphones.

Oh yeah, and being wireless you don't trip over the wire or get hung up on things while you move around the house.If you have a PS4 you can't go wrong with these headphones... you can also plug them into other devices such as iPhones, etc and use them as a conventional wired headset.Nice, flexible, and functional... enough said.Thank you!\n",

      "51183128: Very good overall.  Excellent for the $100 asking price! For wireless headphones they sound very good at this price point.  Just going on sound quality alone I compared them to the Bose QC15 noise cancelling headphones I bought a few years ago.  The difference I see between them is that the Bose headphones go perhaps a quarter octave lower in base response than the PS headphones.  The smaller 40mm drivers in the PS model is the reason why since the Bose uses 50mm driver.  The top end isn't quite as clear on the PS headphones either.  But overall these headphones, while not audiophile quality are still more than adequate for most games.  Microphone sound is also very good not muffled at all... very clear.  I don't think you can do any better for $100. Make sure to download the Sony app especially for these headphones.  One note... these are NOT surround sound.... they're &#34;virtual&#34; surround sound.  Greater spatial sound... but no rear or frontal placement.  so if it's important that you can tell whether or not a sound is coming from the front or behind these are NOT the headphones for you.  My 3 star rating is when comparing to the best that's available.Update 2-19-15I just gently applied a 5 pound sledgehammer to this paperweight.  The microphone only works occasionally.  Yes I was upset to put it outrageously mildly.  You wouldn't have wanted to be in the same room with me while I was applying my &#34;special&#34; treatment!  The headset worked fine for about 7 weeks... then sometimes the microphone would work sometimes it wouldn't.  I wasn't about to put up with sony's customer support so I provided my own support!!  I have tried 4 different headphones from Turtle Beach to Sony with my PS4.  none worked  I HAVE purchased the Turtle Beach P12 WIRED headset which works PERFECTLY, sounds great with excellent microphone sound according to players I play with online.  The P12 is the way to go, for about half the price!!\n",
      "21013175: High Definition Surround Sound Got these for my husband who had been using the ear buds that came with the PS4.  He was making me (and our young kids) crazy with all the booming in the middle of the night.  These have solved the problem.  Now all the action goes direct to his ears and we can all sleep soundly.  The only problem is that the surround sound is SO good, he SHOUTS because he can't hear himself.  Great quality and a great gift for the gamer in your life!\n",

      "25752876: But I'm really satisfied with this headphones There is an emergence of sound when this is connect to the PS4. I could clearly here things that normally I wouldn't on my tv speakers, well maybe if I cranked the volume really high enough, but I'm really satisfied with these headphones. I bought them for this intended use: to hear gaming sound. Normal headphone just didn't cut it and the good and great sounding ones were for music not gaming.     The mic quality is clear and excellent. You can't go wrong with them if you own a ps4 or ps3. Only negative is how long the battery last on a charge.\n",

      "44849302: Clear comfortable headset Got these when they were selling for $69.99 and imo, worth it. The battery life seems pretty good but i only play 3-4 hours at a time if that. Sound is descent also not complaints from other players if that helps.\n",
      "22540441: Awesome. I didn't actually buy this headset from Amazon, rather I snagged it from Target for the same price. I was compelled to write a review, however, as this is by far the best headset I have owned.These headphones are wireless, but can be worn/used while charging (and used effectively like a wired headset) using a micro-USB cable. Sadly they do not operate via USB, but that can be overlooked in light of the fact that they can be used with practically any device. They have a wireless dongle for USB connections (sufficient for any modern computer), and a 3.5 mm jack for wired connections (good for devices like phones/tablets that lack a USB port).When used with a Playstation, you can adjust the fader of VOIP vs. game audio using the forward volume toggle. There is also a master volume toggle on the back. Both of these rockers are easy to find by touch, easy to press, and both emit a tone so that you know you have pressed the button. Same goes for the mute button, the Virtual Surround Sound button (VSS, as best I can tell, adjusts the balance of treble vs. bass for crisper audio, but may do more that I can't discern), and the power toggle.The speakers themselves, as I understand it, use virtualized 7.1 surround sound - but I really can't tell the difference. I am able to tell from what direction a sound is originating very easily, and can't discern any gaps between angles. They have good range, solid bass, and very clear treble.Finally, the actual design of them is awesome. My ears are typically too big for headphones like these to sit comfortably. In fact, this is the only pair I've ever owned that I could wear for any extended period of time without experiencing pain. I recommend these to anybody!\n",

      "16541177: Amazing headset!! I have been using this headset for a week now and they really are amazing.  I was using a set of Turtle Beach wired headsets from my PS3 and decided to get these after getting tired of not being able to separately adjust my chat and game volume.  You plug in the wireless transmitter in the PS4 usb port and away you go.  They have a very clean audio with no hissing or distortion.  I was amazed by the additional sound I now hear after upgrading from stereo headsets. By pressing your PS button on the controller you get a display of battery life, mic mute, surround sound active in the same manner as you get controller stats.  This is made for PS4 and the integration is flawless.  These ear cups really surround my ears and block most outside noise and I don't have to turn up the volume to hear the games.  The on switch has 3 positions off, normal audio(1) and bass boost(2). They seem to be really well made but I will update if I have any troubles in the future.  My cons would be no way do I get 10 hours battery life more like 5-6 hours and they are a bit snug but not to where they are annoying.\n",

      "7985207: These headphones are a great deal! I like my games loud. I bought these headphones because my wife would frequently complain about the noisy gunfire, sirens, etc.     I have a nice home theater setup, and these headphones come pretty close to replicating the same experience. In my opinion, the highs produced by these headphones sound even better than the home theater. The bass can't compete, but still sounds really good (for headphones).     At $99, these noise cancelling headphones are a great deal (compared to other similarly priced headphones), however I bought these for $69.99 during a 2014 Black Friday sale.    I'm a big guy, and my head and ears are admittedly larger than most people, but these adjustable headphones fit perfectly.     With the latest software update, you can adjust the EQ settings (High/Mid/Low) for a particular game or movie, although only one EQ setting can be saved on the headphones at a time. The headphones have 2 modes controlled via a physical slider: (1) normal mode, and (2) whatever EQ setting is currently saved on the headphones.    The battery lasts about 3-4 hours, and the headphones are recharged via a micro USB plug.    It's important to note, these headphones only simulate 7.1 surround sound for the PS3 and PS4, however they produce remarkable STEREO sound when plugged into to any other device. Also, the included USB dongle (resembling a flash drive) must be connected to a USB port on the PS3/PS4, otherwise these headphones will not work.    With these headphones on, I can now crank up the volume on the PlayStation, any time of day, without disturbing anyone. 5 stars!\n",

You cannot turn the sound down manually without the drive in the PS4.  After having the headset for a year, one of the sides came out, and the only way that I could use it would be to tape it together.  I ended up just throwing the headset away.\n",

      "30109303: Top quality official headset ♦ Brief ♦I've been through all the past official wireless headsets that have come out (7.1 Stereo Wireless Headset & Pulses) and have always been impressed, so when this one was announced I was more than eager to get my hands on them.With the previous models, the Pulses were the \\\\\"successor\\\\\" to the 7.1 Stereo Wireless Headset, however with this newer version, I'm rather unsure whether these are a successor to the Pulses... They both have certain features which are better than each other.That said, these are undoubtedly very high quality in both sound and comfort.♦ What's in the box? ♦7.1 Wireless Stereo Headset 2.0 | USB Dongle* | Micro USB Cable** | Stereo Cable*** | Carry Case | Manual/Documents.* This is vital to connect your PS3/PS4 via a wireless connection, do not lose this as you can't buy these separately.** Unlike the Pulses, these actually come with a charging cable, HOORAH! Except the cable is rather short.*** This cable is used to connect the headset to a Vita or a Dualshock 4 controller; using it this way will mean you don't need to turn the headset on, nor does the headset has to have any charge.♦ Set-Up & Using ♦As I'm sure you're aware of, this headset works with the PS4, PS3 & PS Vita, whichever console you're planning on connecting this headset to, the set-up is very simple and easy to do, just follow one of the steps below.- PlayStation 4 -Wireless Set-Up:1) Insert USB dongle into the PS4.2) Turn the headset on.3) Select the user profile you want to link the headset to (asks every time you turn them on).If you have two of these headsets, you can actually use them both at the same time using two different user profiles, this means you can even both participate in the same party chat.Wired Set-Up:1) Plug the stereo cable into the headset.2) Insert the other end of the cable into the Dualshock 4 controller.Whichever set-up you go for, if no game sound is going to the headset, follow these steps:Settings > Sound and Screen > Audio Output Settings > Output to Headphones > All audio.Alternatively, hold the PS button down and go to \\\\\"Adjust Devices\\\\\", you can also tweak the settings there.- PlayStation 3 -Wireless Set-Up:1) Insert USB dongle into the PS3.2) Turn the headset on.The PS3 should configure everything automatically.- PlayStation Vita -Wired Set-Up:1) Plug the stereo cable into the headset.2) Insert the other end of the cable into the Vita.♦ Headset Functions ♦There are many functions on the headset itself, most of which are only usable when wirelessly connected.- Pre-Set Sound Mode -When turning on the headset, if you skip over to '2' rather than '1', you can select to use a special pre-set sound mode which enhances the sound to that specific genre, such as \\\\\"shooter\\\\\" or \\\\\"music\\\\\" etc...Though you will need to set it up by firstly downloading the 'Headset Companion App', then connect the headset to your PS3/PS4 and upload a sound profile to it through the app.- Sound/Chat -This allows you to adjust the ratio of chat to in-game audio; you can have it balanced, or more swayed to one or the other.- Volume -Will adjust the overall volume.- VSS (Virtual Surround Sound) -Hold this button down to disable/enable, with VSS enabled, you will get the 7.1 VSS.- Mute -This will mute/unmute the microphone.♦ Comfort & Sound Quality ♦This headset is extremely comfortable overall, both the headband and earpads are super soft which make these very comfortable over longer periods of time.Sound quality is great, especially when using the specific sound profiles available on the headset companion app. I've used the shooter profile on games such as Battlefield 4 & Resogun and am pleased with the results; great sense of direction with clear and crisp sound.I've had to ask others for their opinion of my mic quality as I can't hear it myself, and everyone I've asked has said they can hear me very clearly, which is good as the microphone is completely hidden.There is one downside to this and the other previous models which didn't used to bother me, but has been recently, and that has to do with there being no playback when talking on the microphone. Due to the over-ear design, you can't really hear yourself when talking, so as the volume gets louder, you'll find yourself talking more loudly.I hope they can implement an update sometime in the future that will sort this issue out...♦ Gold Headset -VS- Pulse Headset ♦- Gold Headset -+ Foldable design making it easier to store.+ Slightly more comfortable than the Pulses, probably due to it being more lightweight as well as extra width of headband.+ Sound has been improved a bit from the Pulses.+ Longer battery life (up from 6 hours to 8).+ Cheaper in cost (I paid £75 on first release which is £20-£30 cheaper than the Pulses).- Pulse Headset -+ Slider controls rather than buttons.+ Bass impact (was a love or hate feature).+ Multiple sound profiles available to select through at once.+ Has an aux port on the dongle for additional wireless usage with certain devices.Both are great headsets to which both also have their ups and downs compared to each other, however I seem to be using the Golds more.♦ Overall Opinion ♦This is a pretty solid headset that's available for a premium price, though I honestly believe it's money well spent... They're comfortable which means I can wear them for long gaming sessions, and with its crisp sound & VSS feature, it makes me feel more immersed with the gameplay.I've owned these for about half a year now and couldn't recommend them enough.nd quality is great, especially when using the specific sound profiles available on the headset companion app. I've used the shooter profile on games such as Battlefield 4 & Resogun and am pleased with the results; great sense of direction with clear and crisp sound.I've had to ask others for their opinion of my mic quality as I can't hear it myself, and everyone I've asked has said they can hear me very clearly, which is good as the microphone is completely hidden.There is one downside to this and the other previous models which didn't used to bother me, but has been recently, and that has to do with there being no playback when talking on the microphone.

The initial charge time is about 3 hours and then it runs smooth. The voice is clear and chat is awesome. The speaker is hidden but can talk and others can hear clearly without any issues.This is not a complaint but a question: The one thing i tried and was unsuccessful was i could not connect it directly to a smart TV with the Bluetooth dongle that came with the headset. Will research on how to connect this directly to a TV. If anyone has an idea or a solution please advise.\n",

      "73192: Indestructible So for me, buying the official play station headset was a given, but i didn't realize how amazon these are. Hands down the best headset ice ever owed. All my turtle beach headsets break after a while. I even bought a pair for my boyfriend and i know he throws headsets when he goes rage. This headset folds up (inwards) when pressure isn't separating the ear parts, and also the adjusting part is on the inside of the headset. So no more throwing a headset and having the adjusting part break.Just a great headset. I'm looking to buy another one soon, but in looking for a wired pair. Seems like playing the raid on Destiny for hours straight really drains the battery lol\n",
      "11066347: Gaming imersion here i come! Pretty good headsets..you'll have to mess around with the Playstation Headset companion app to find the sound that you enjoy best. Only complaint is the design of the headset feels pretty cheap...but for 100 bucks your gettin a pretty good Headset.\n",

I'm always having to hold my hand up to mouth so that my online buddies can hear me. They are always complaining that I sound like a robot or that I sound like I'm under water.It's not the Internet connection or any interference.They are also  like ear muffs. They make you sweat.Overall good for the price!!\n",
      "50548916: Recommend these headphones due to great sound and long battery life. I had the previous all black Sony PS3 wireless headset and while I find that the old one was more intuitive as this one has switches that with the exception of the Off-1-2 switch are hard to feel when you are wearing them. The battery life however is much, much better than the previous model. So far I could use it for several hours, probably like five or six, and haven't had to charge them. I also like that they use a micro-usb cable to charge, now I can use my cellphone charge and don't need yet another cable. Great sound too, I like that I can set the sound in the PS3 with the app.\n",

You get full, booming sound, voice chat, wireless ease and built-in volume controls for PlayStation that avoid digging through menus. Best part is I can hear my games without disturbing others. It even works on my MacBook. One of my favorite accessories.\n",
      "34615837: Its alright Great sound , good comfort, it's lite and a great fit for people who have large heads.  The charge lasts a few hours at best.  The big problem I have is the terrible mic quality.  People are always saying they can barely hear me or I am muffled.\n",

Nothing to write home about. If I could go back in time, I wish I had spent the extra money on a more expensive headset though.This one gets me by for now, but I'm not totally happy with it.\n",
      "13851096: Update:  didn't last a year (adult owned) 11 month update:   Previously I gave these 5 stars, as they seemed like great value for the price.   Well, I was expecting these to last more than 11 months.   This headset was adult-owned, treated with care.   However, this headset fell apart in my very hands this evening as I was getting ready to put them on.   It still works, but the frame is flawed and only plastic.   Thus, I have electric tape keeping them together while I save up for a headset that isn't Sony Gold wireless.\n",

      "10301100: Perfect for PS4 Made perfectly for the PS4, and amazing quality for the $80 I purchased it for. Sony is great at making quality items for less. The only con of this item is that it uses a usb stick instead of bluetooth, but that is really only a minor annoyance and well worth dealing with.\n",

Compatible with PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox ONE (needs 3.5mm jack adapter and firmware update on controls), Xbox 360 (need a 3.5mm with mic male to 2.5 mm with mic male cable), any audio device and even cellphone as hands free (but you dont really want them for that, trust me).

      "17035878: clearly a big upgrade from previous Playstation headset. Even though the pulse elite holds more options, this alternative has half of the wait with great sound. Use them for both work and party chat on ps4. Mic quality, 2X battery (in comparison to pulse elite) and great fit makes this the best of the two.\n",

NOT A BLUETOOTH HEADSET.USES STANDARD 2.4GHZ RF WI-FI.If you are thinking of purchasing this as an all-entertainment-device, you're making a mistake.It will not &#34;pair&#34; with your iOS/OSX devices.

      "38539974: Very poor plastic hinge design. DO NOT BUY.  There are other manufacturers making PS4 compatible headsets now.  Although I loved them, the hinge broke only after a few months.  I was taking very good care of them.  I did not drop it or mistreat them at all, but I did wear them every day.  I am a mechanical engineer.  There is a very high stress concentration between a thin plastic hinge and a metal rod.  Simply putting them on every day results in cycle fatigue on this joint.  The larger your head, or the more times you wear them, the worse you will be.  My hat size is only 7-1/4.I sent in the headphones to Sony for a warranty repair and they rejected them for &#34;being neglected&#34;, which is not true at all. The cloth inside the ear cups also comes out easily... maybe due to sweat.  The customer service rep said this may be why they were marked &#34;neglected&#34;, but the service supervisor said there was nothing he could do about it.  I have two of these headsets (one now broken), three PS3's, one PS4, a $4,000 Sony TV, two Vaio laptops, a Sony HD camcorder, and 3 Sony cameras.All it took was a $99 pair of headphones to be the last thing I ever buy from Sony.\n",

      "13044738: Ears Hurt, No bass, pretty but dull. I bought these last week, and am very disappointed. I thought that since they are a Sony audio product that they would be a great sounding headset. I was wrong. There is NO BASS. I couldn't beleive how quiet the almost non existent bass is. I play a lot of Battlefield 4 on PS4, and couldn't hear basic foot steps and the shots being fired sounded like fire crackers, and the &#34;surround sound&#34; is comical at best.  They are sleek and pretty. They are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE! I wear glass and have a 7 1/2 hat size and this headset made my ears ache after a while. My ears are still sore and I've had them off for over an hour. I ordered a pair of hyperX cloud just now to replace these. Sony needs to go back to the drawing board with headsets or just step out of the game. I got lured in by all the 5 star ratings, but should have read the 1 stars. I gave them a week to see if I'd grow into them...not at all! Can't wait to return them to best buy.\n",

The only 2 small negatives I have are:1. the sound is sometimes a little too low for my taste, I wish it had a few decibels more to spare.2. when you talk, you don't hear yourself speaking, so you don't know how loud you are actually speaking.Otherwise these are a great pair of wireless headsets for the PS4.\n",

I love these headset and would recommend it to Gamelovers!\n",

These are light, I forget I'm wearing them, and I hear little details in my environment that I didn't hear before.  Playing the games is now at a whole new level.  I'm happy these contribute to maximizing the few hours per week I get to reward myself with gaming.\n",

      "11035929: I loved these headphones before they broke, but not now.  They are cheaply made. I have had this for almost a month and so far, I love these headphones.  I use these to listen to music and place phone calls using Skype.  It is a pleasure being able to talk to friends without holding a phone in my hands and the freedom of using headphones that are not tethered to the computer.  The volume control is excellent with a high range of volumes which comes in handy when talking to someone that has a soft voice.  I have asked several people if they can hear me clearly and they have always said yes, so I know the mic works fine without me having to raise my voice to be heard.  If I was picky, I would rate the sound of music as a little less that a 10; I would give it a 9.95.  Now that is being picky!!  :-)Update 4-25-2016The headphone band broke and is now useless.  This was the second PlayStation headphone I bought, the first one broke the same way this one just did.  When I bought the second identical headset, I felt that the first one that failed was just a fluke and it would not happen again but I was wrong.  The headband is poorly designed and repeat use over stresses the plastic material and it will break.\n",
      "10300951: but for a wireless headset they are great. VSS works good For the price, you can't go wrong. Not as bassy as some I've owned in the past, but for a wireless headset they are great. VSS works good, and the side tone is a nice feature so you can hear yourself in the headset so you don't end up yelling over all the other noise. The custom profiles are a cool added feature as well. So far I've only used them for Destiny and COD, but they are working out great. I recommend them.\n",
      "23868596: Four Stars Build quality could be better.\n",
      "42330218: Great but not totally necessary for the PS4 These are great, comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent.  I use these mostly for my PS3, to keep noise down for my sleeping wife.  I own a PS4, but I have trouble recommending them.  Anyone who is getting these more to keep gaming noise down should be aware that the new controllers for the Playstation 4 have a headphone jack in them.  If you already have a great set of headphones that you like, well you can just plug these into your controller and all sounds cease coming out of your TV.  I can use the mic on my headphones to chat with other players.  So, if you have a PS4, think before you drop the $100.  If you absolutely need a wireless headset, get these-they have great sound and are very comfortable.\n",

I was going to pick up a pair of A50's but decided to give these a shot as I read so many good reviews about them and I must say I am glad of my choice. Very comfortable and wireless, you cant get any better for the price.

Apparently many others find it comfortable, so it might be suitable for some. For me, it's unbearable I am looking for replacement.\n",

      "39482138: Great for playing offline / good for playing online (chat) When using them just for game audio, they are awesome. 5 stars, highly recommended. But when communicating with people via chat, they lose a little luster. The game audio cuts out for a second here & there when people are silent. I'm sure the mic picks up ambient sound, assumes the person is about to speak or speaking and mutes the game, but it is noticeable. Still a really good value & I would recommend them highly.\n",

      "44415648: Above average quality, very convenient to use. Everything about this pair of headphones is good. Not great, but good. The selling point for me was the fact that they are very convenient and easy to use. No wires, no batteries; just plug the small USB receiver into the port and turn the headphones on. They work quite well with my PS4 and computer.\n",
      "23356469: Do not purchase if you have a big head Pretty decent set of headphones. I'm not an audiophile, but I wouldn't buy PS4, wireless headphones for that reason. The range is so-so and the battery life isn't particularly remarkable. However, these are reliable and have pretty good sound and microphone quality.  Update: I have now gone through two pairs of these. If you have a big head, DO NOT BUY THESE. The plastic they are made of is cheap. It WILL snap. Each of my lasted about a year. One just snapped where tension would be and the second had a flimsy piece of plastic snap which made the rods that hold the lower section in place fall out.  Secondly, the material that covers the foam cushion began coming unglued on both sets. I suspect this is because, again, I have a big head, but also because I'm bald (perhaps the heat and oils from my scalp weakened the adhesive).   I strongly advise against purchasing this product, especially if you have a big head.\n",

I have to keep looking at the box to see if I have the same headphones that the rest of these reviewers have.These are uncomfortable and have dramatically worse sound quality than my $60 pair of cheapo headphones that I use at the gym, Sennheiser PX-100.  Even worse, the guys I play Destiny with report that they cannot hear me as well on these Sony's as they did with the PX-100's (which has just a cheap mic built into the smartphone controls on the cord).The positional audio is essentially worthless, I find it highly laughable these are marketed as 7.1 as there is virtually no separation of front channel to rear channel.Finally, these feel really flimsy and I do not see the value of having a wireless headset when the PS4 controller has an audio jack right there to use.\n",

      "50764859: Buyer Beware - subpar. Considering that these are a sony product supposed to work with PS4 - the ease of connectivity and reliability are terrible.  Ours did not work  and researching online it appears to be a known issue.  All Sony manuals and troubleshooting say nothing of this problem.  After over and hour on \\\\\"hold\\\\\" I eventually got a hold of Sony Customer Service (and I use that term very loosely).  The rudest, slowest most condescending customer service agent directed us to reset back to factory defaults and try again.  Then stated if it doesn't work call us back.  \\\\\"Not so fast buddy.....you will stay right here and see this to conclusion\\\\\".  The \\\\\"fix\\\\\" did work for now - but I honestly do not hold out much hope of it lasting from what I have read it is an ongoing issue.  How hard would it be for Sony to provide some clear direction online.  The kicker is that sony is so proprietary that no other headphones will work.  In short - you will buy our s***ty sub par product or go without.  What was supposed to be a fun afternoon turned into a total stress trip.  I will be following up with Sony regarding their customer service but expect to hear nothing.  Buyer beware...........\n",

The biggest problem I found with the Pulse was the durability issue, and a lot of people complained about that as well. These are built very differently, obviously, and so I don't think durability is an issue. Still a bit too early for me to judge, but it does seem quite solid. Of course, like the previous models, they're compatible with computers, phones and TVs, so they work really well. The sound quality is always top notch for it's price. Highly recommend this product if you don't want to burn $300 for an Astro headset.\n",
      "24440288: PS Gold Wireless Headset is worth it! Pros: Great sound from it and blocks out a majority of outside noise. Directional Mic is pretty good as well for the price.Cons: Can get pretty uncomfortable and sweaty after prolonged use, but still more comfortable than other competitors. Battery life leaves more to be desired. Only getting about 3-4 hours before needing a recharge, but the included auxiliary cable to the controller helps with that problem.Overall, this headset is definitely a must-have for PS4 owners. Sound quality and microphone works better than you'd imagine for the price!\n",

      "52769429: CHEAP and FLIMSY Sound, 5 stars.Quality, 0 StarsI am not a serious gamer, only playing a few hours a week. After owning these for two months the plastic broke at one of its pivot points and now my $80 headphones are junk as they no longer stay together to be wearable. I guess I could duct tape them together but that is pretty shoddy considering the amount of use I got out of so little wear.I am the only user of them and when not in use they sit undisturbed on my desk here in my office at home. If you have kids using these or may become a little animated while game playing where you might &#34;briskly&#34; remove them from your head... look for something less expensive or make sure you are getting what you pay for quality wise.In the included photo you can see what little plastic there is at the pivot point and how easily it can break.\n",

My only two gripes are that the cord that comes with it to recharge it is incredibly tiny and when in wireless with the ps4 you can max out the volume. Besides that its great. My favorite feature is the custom audio mixes you download to it. There are only a few to pick but some completely change the audio in games and music in a good way.\n",
      "13686475: Could not be happier Great headset. I've always been content with the speakers on my television and a mono headset/mic. These have changed the way I game.

I exchanged my broken one for a new one tonight so we'll see how long this one lasts.

      "30748561: Great headphones for gaming. Nice headset.  The sound is good overall.  Bass can be improved in a custom menu on PS4...it's fine but not thumping.  Don't get me wrong, though...it's not terribly weak.  Other reviews had me scared before I ordered them for myself.  It's all personal preference.  Personally I don't want bass in my video games to rattle my brain and overpower other game sound.  These pack enough punch for explosions and whatnot when you tweak them.  Wireless is beast, of course.  The other features are just a bonus in my opinion.  The ability to use them with my mp3 player and phone is cool but I doubt I'll ever really use them for that.

I am no expert on sound or anything, just a regular guy looking for a good headset for gaming, watching movies and listening to music while I study.  So far these have exceeded all my expectations, for this price you cannot beat these!  I love that fact that they are wireless and pretty comfortable even after prolonged use.  It's unfortunate that they use a USB toggle and not Bluetooth so they do not work wirelessly with my iPhone or other devices but they do it with the PS4 and Macbook.  The sound is GREAT for listening to music or playing any kind of game on the PS4.  The sound does leak a little when the volume is really high but that is not an issue for me since I would never listen to anything with the volume at max.  The mic seems to be great as well, I have not heard any complaints from my friends with regards to hearing me.  Overall I love these so far and would recommend them for anyone looks for a great overall wireless headset thats great for gaming as well.\n",

      "49152205: Amazing piece of technology! Just not bluetooth! This is an almost perfect product, I love playing Shadow of the Colossus with this thing, Final Fantasy XIII and Kingdom Hearts also go great with it. You can even listen to music while doing things around the house, or listen to a movie. It even contains a little baggy to hold it, the USB and the charger it comes with. Only problem is you CAN NOT use it as a bluetooth headset, it is not compatible with any iphone, or android or any blutooth compatible device, the proprietary USB is proof of that. Though I have not tried it, you can use this with your laptop and such as long as it communicates with the USB. You can however use the audio jack it comes with to hook it up wired to your phone, tablet, PS Vita and PSP systems and it will work and sound just as great, though it's even more great when your playing a game. Now you also need to be a certain few feet away from the usb when using it with your ps3 and laptop, so I don't reccomend taking it to the bathroom! Lol9/10 magnificent headset!\n",

      "20136328: Great Value and Functionality I purchased this headset for a few reasons and it has met all of my expectations so far.  These are extremely comfortable and easy to adjust in both size and volume.  You can adjust the balance of voice to game music which makes communicating in multi-player situations very easy.  You can also easily mute yourself for when your wife gets home and your dogs start barking.  So far, I have only used them to play Destiny, both single and multi-player.  Even at low volume, you feel much more immersed in the game world with all of the directional audio becoming more clear.  I haven't cranked the volume up so I can't speak to maximum volume levels or distortion, but at a level in which long term hearing damage isn't a concern, they sound great.Setting them up is easy.  You just plug the wireless adapter into the USB port on the PS4, then go into audio settings and set the output to the headset.  After the first time, they automatically switch over when turned on.I have not had any issues with range.  On occasion, I will use my Airdyne while playing from about 15 feet from the PS4, and I can walk to my kitchen which is about 30 feet away, and they still work fine.Charging them is easy and the battery lasts for quite some time.  I used them for about 4 hours straight without them being close to discharged.  The folding ability and carrying case is a nice touch since these are comfortable for use on a plane.Overall, I give this headset five stars for its balance of features and performance to price.\n",
      "33781808: but these headphones have great sounds and a very comfortable Perhaps a bit overpriced, but these headphones have great sounds and a very comfortable. Extremely easy to plug-and-play on the PS4, and surprisingly, extremely easy to use on PC as well.\n",

Really impressed so far; solid construction, comfortable, great sound quality, quick to charge, good range. The best feature has to be the virtual surround sound, which is very helpful in quiet games like Last of Us and greatly improves experience of watching action movies. Yes you can probably get better quality with Bose QC or similar, but you will pay twice as much. These are the best for the price. Only complaint is I wish they would connect to the PS4 without needing a USB dongle plugged in. But otherwise, very satisfied.\n",

      "36874130: DO NOT BUY THESE PS4 WIRELESS GOLD HEADSETS NO MATTER WHAT! DO NOT BUY THESE NO MATTER WHAT! This product has a design flaw. These units have a hinge held together by a brittle 1mm piece of plastic. if you simply lift these up from one end, there is a good chance they will snap the thin plastic (the black part you can see in the image over the blue part) holding 2 pieces together and they will no longer fit snug to your head. I returned them to SONY for a warranty exchange after speaking to them about it. They are aware of the problem. They sent them back to me after a few weeks EXACTLY the way I sent them to them with no explanation. I spent time and money on shipping back and now I have broken headphones which broke 90 days into using them. I did research and there are MANY similar complaints on this product even on the SONY forums. They then told me when I called back they don't have a policy to replace broken items, only to fix defective working parts. And the person I spoke to at SONY said he gets this call all the time but has no authority to do anything about it. Basically saying you have to return them to where you bought it. Only most places aren't going to accept the return after 30 days. I am now contacting amazon and if necessary will have to deal with Visa, but that may jeopardize my relationship with Amazon if I were to charge this charge back...\n",

      "37841703: Very nice sound, and great for its intended use, but I should've read every review and specs better These headphones are a great value for the money. Very nice sound, comfortable, and work great with my PC and PS3.Unfortunately, I bought them also to watch TV while my wife sleeps, and this is where I made the mistake.I knew the product used a USB dongle, but I (don't know why) assumed the dongle had a headphone jack, and could be used with the TV's USB power, while being connected to the earphones output.I was obviously mistaken. There is another Sony product that has this feature (can't recall it's name)Don't get me wrong.. I've given the product a five stars, because it does what it was intended to to by design, and works perfectly fine. I'm the one that made a wrong assumption.I CAN use the headphones with a cable, but there's no point in having a wireless headset, just to have it plugged via a 15 foot cable to the TV!Forgetting about my mistake, the only thing I'm missing, is that I'd like to have a second dongle, so I can have one on the PC and one on the PS3.. I don't use them at the same time, but removing the dongle from one to put it on the other a couple of times a day, is a little bit tedious.\n",

I bought my PlayStation Gold Wireless headset used onlu once from CL from a guy who didn't know how to use them so I got an exceptionally good deal! I have had them for about a month now and I absolutely love them! The sound is amazing, loud and clear, the mic is completely clear, the custom game modes from the companion app are great and you really get to hear the games sound the way the designers meant for you to. The 7.1 surround sound is excellent, the battery life is phenominal and lasts about 9 or 10hrs on a full charge, they have great range, I can wear them anywhere in the house and keep chatting with no interference, they are lightweight and comfortable with easy access to all controls! I cannot say enough good things about this headset, Sony really wins the gold with this headset and for the price, you can't go wrong!!!\n",

The earcups can pivot in to make the headphones smaller/fit in a case.  Well, when you put the headphones on, that pivot has outward pressure put on it directly on the plastic hinge.  The first pair lasted two months, the second pair lasted three months.

      "18918872: Not cost efficient, purchase a cheaper brand Headset worked well for around six months, then the microphone started to distort my voice.  It is currently almost a year old and my voice comes across so full of vibrations and distortions that the others I am playing online with have consitently asked me to mute it when not speaking.  Many have asked me to not use it at all.  So, therefore, I feel that these were not a cost effective head set for me.  They did not last long enough before having issues.  I also do not like the folding of the headset where it is always folding up when trying to put it on with one hand, so you have to use two.  Last complaint, the battery does not last long.However, they were very comfortable and could wear for hours without discomfort.  And, as I stated, for the first six months they were excellent.\n",

      "26688277: Great quality headset and amazing sound with the correct profile! I bought the Pulse headset along with the Gold to compare them. They are similar but also very different. The Pulse sends pulses/vibrations which I thought would sound and feel good but were actually not. Also the Pulse headset was lacking in comfort and seemed fragile.The Gold headsets however does the exact same thing compared to the Pulse with no vibration, greater comfort, better build and a much lesser cost. I bought it when it was $70.They are a plug and go. However I do recommend that you download the companion app and upload one of the sound profiles to the headset (note: the headset has to be connected by cable) and select option 2. The default option 1 is highly lacking in depth. I generally always use the Infamous SS sound profile as default because it gives that best sound. Also, select the proper sound profile makes a lot of difference.I know some people say that the sound in virtual surround is not good. I disagree. The sound is great as long as the correct profile has been selected for option 2 - and there really is surround. It is not as prominent as a good surround sound system, but it is very good given the price and it is of course better than waking up the whole neighborhood.\n",
      "11692395: but the battery lasts a long time and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time The sound isn't for audiophiles, but the battery lasts a long time and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I can't complain.  For their use, they're perfect.\n",
      "43739921: Worth Every Penny I can't say anything bad about these headphones. I love my surround sound stereo but sometimes my family members do not. I used to have a much more expensive pair of Turtle Beach headphones for my old playstation that I did not like. They would pop and crackle in your ear for no reason and eat up batteries faster than I could buy them. Needless to say they were a big waste of money. So when I saw the playstation ones, I was reluctant to give them a try. The price was good, being less than half of the Turtle Beach, and are very comfortable on the noggin for extended play sessions. The rechargeable battery is great and lasts just slightly less than the controller batteries do. But the best part is the sound! They sound every bit as good as the Turtle Beach without any annoying popping or cracklings in your ear. There is no mic boom so I thought chatting would be bad but all my friends can hear me just fine. Another great feature is when the playstation detects them, it automatically mutes my stereo. Very cool!The only thing I can complain about is the charging cord is a foot long and proprietary. A foot long?! I guess you can't wear them while charging. Besides that these are a must have.\n",
      "5434043: Comfortable with pretty good sound quality Comfortable with pretty good sound quality.  You cannot beat this headset for the price.  The custom settings that are available on PS4 are very nice.  The downside is that the hinges and padding are pretty low quality.\n",

      "46124016: Five Stars very good\n",
      "48980975: Great buy and very versatile This is easily one of the best headsets just in general I have owned.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I just enjoy it that much.  The only downside is that it isn't blue tooth.  If it were it would be the perfect bang for the buck when it comes to gaming headsets out there, but it really already is even with it not being blue tooth.  The sound quality is what you would expect.  There isn't a lot of bass response in my opinion but for 100 bucks and with all the other functions it offers you can't ask for much.  They are fantastic for gaming.  I have a PS4 hence the reason I bought this set and they really do a fantastic job.  The invisible microphone is great.  I haven't had any complaints from my buddies about not being able to hear me or anything and its nice not having a mic boom dangling in front of your face.  Plus you have the added benefit of being completely wireless which to some isn't a big deal but to me it is.  This 2014..  We shouldn't be messing with wires when it comes to audio devices.I also really enjoy the fact that you can install the driver on your computer and use this headset wireless with your PC.  The only downside to this is that your mic gets a little bit of static, but I'm not really a PC gamer so its not a huge deal for me.  Even if I were I think I would be willing to make the sacrifice for a wireless headset that only costs 100 bucks.They also come with an auxiliary cable so  you can use them with your phone or ipod/mp3 players etc.These are overall a great value, and if you area  PS4 gamer looking for a headset I recommend these over the turtle beach headsets mainly because there isn't blue tooth support for going wireless yet.  When they address that my opinion may change, but I am very pleased with the quality of this headset and the added benefit of being able to use it on PC and my mobile devices is awesome.  The build quality is of an acceptable caliber as well.  They almost feel flimsy but once you get themon you realize that the way they are designed really helps make them comfortable.  Again I highly recommend these bad boys for you PS4 gamers out there.  Great buy especially if you are lucky enough to find a good used set.  That's what I did.  Just gave them a good alcohol bath before I used them.\n",

      "1096376: EXCELLENT JOB SONY! BEST 2014 GAMING HEADSETS EVER! Great headsets for any purpose. I use them on the computer and on the PS4.\n",
      "18315887: so searching for a headset that would be comfortable for me has been a huge undertaking I bought this headset mostly for chat and for the virtual surround sound.  I have both glasses and 1 inch gauges, so searching for a headset that would be comfortable for me has been a huge undertaking.  This is by far the best wireless headset I've used.  After a few hours of use my ears, which JUST fit into the cups, start to feel uncomfortable.  But this is much better than the Ear Force 400's I tried before, which caused discomfort after about an hour.  The chat and sound quality are superb, and many games on the PS4 have equalizer settings modified by the specific game developers for their preferred soundscapes.  Aside from the eventual discomfort, caused by my ear modifications and not by any fault of the manufacturer, this headset is miles above the rest.\n",

Great sound and great comfort, easy to use and do not require power when used with a mobile phone or PSP which is an added bonus... I tested these headphones while playing Call of Duty Ghost, and Battlefield 4...AMAZING virtual 7.1 surround.  I also used these with Netflix and again was impressed with the great sound for such a relatively cheap price. I am very happy with my purchase of these and my only small complain would be why Sony didn't go full Bluetooth on these?\n",

The sound cuts out intermittently about every 3 minutes for about 10 seconds. It is extremely annoying and unusable.I will be looking for a replacement pair from some other brand as Sony support wants me to pay to have them shipped and repaired. I don't even have an option to return them due to them being faulty. I probably got a lemon, but no one at Sony seems to care about one person's experience. Just my two cents.\n",

      "43861271: 7.1 VSS! Wait... WUT?! This is a fantastic headset! As long as you limit your gaming sessions to around 5 hours. Not sure, but the battery life of my unit doesn't last all that long. Anyway, it works with the PS3/PS4 and Windows PCs. The latter doesn't get 7.1 Virtual Surround Sound support which makes it just a nice wireless stereo headset for PC gaming. But... on the consoles it delivers lush surround sound that brings games to life. There are even special game specific settings that can be downloaded on the PS4 and loaded onto the headset (1 at a time).Don't buy this at full cost. Wait for a sale. Got mine for $50 and I'm glad because at $99 it would have been more of a disappointment due to it's drawbacks.\n",

      "1048881: Definitely a Gold Buy Compared to my previous headset this was definitely an upgrade. I had the other playstation headset. Compared to that headset, this one sounds so much better and overall is so much better.Pros:-Comes with a headphone cord for devices that can't use the Bluetooth usb device.-Bends for more portablility.-There are three options;  -0: Off.  -1: On  -2: Bass Boost (definitely noticeable)-Your voice playbacks through the headset so you won't be talking loudly through your headset anymore.Cons:-it hurts your ears sometimes.The previous headset i had was comfortable, while this one does hurt your ears sometimes and i don't know why. This is why i gave it a 4/5 just because it fits too tight and hurts because of it, i suppose?Also my friends said the microphone itself isn't as good as my previous headset but I haven't heard it myself.This isn't just for the gamer, but also the music lover. Music sounds so much better when it's set to bass boost and connected to your computer or ps3. You basically rediscover music if you've never had a headset like this.Normally if your trying to hear the enemy you have to have some sort or perk on. With this headset you don't need it. I've heard people and was able to react without perks like dead silence. With this &#34;sound-whoring&#34; perks you become a monster.Bottom line: I've never been able to game on this level. I've heard so many more things and have been able to react faster. Also my music library sounds so much better when i use bass boost but even connecting via the headphone jack is an improvement. The only downside is that it hurts my ears sometimes and it pretty much bends the ear skin if that makes sense, sometimes.It's worth it. If you have a question hit me up on I'll get back to you quickly: @legitcereal~Brandon\n",
      "45580289: Initial review: Solid product with a couple flaws. I was hesitant about purchasing this headset after reading some negative reviews. After unsuccessfully searching for another simple solution (not involving an optical wireless broadcasting box that would make switching between headset and home theatre audio a hassle) I decided to give them a shot. I just received the headset today, and have gotten a few hours of gaming in to test them out, and I'm pleased with the initial results.They are comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is very good considering the price point, although the bass did disappoint me at first. The microphone picks up my voice loud and clear without any complaints from other players (rather, I've received compliments from friends on how clear the Mic sounds). Installation is simple, as are the on board controls once you take a good look at them. The charging cable is extremely short, so forget about play and charge out of the box. The range of the wireless receiver is quite short, with audio beginning to break up 9-10 feet away. This isn't a problem in most living room setups, but if you switch TV's/rooms at times like I do, you're going to have difficulties with reception.Advice: Make sure to update the firmware using the app by restoring factory default while the headset is plugged in to your PlayStation. There is no documentation provided with the headset on this, and they don't make it very clear in the app either, but it's a good idea for those of you having issues.PROS:Excellent valueComfortableEasy to set up/use/disableGood sound qualityGood micCONS:Less than stellar bassExtremely short charging/sync cableShort wireless rangePoor documention on firmware updates\n",

      "46894547: Only better because of no chat cable. Switched from Turtle beach PX4.  I loved the PX4's.  These sound just as good and are cheaper and you don't have to use the chat cable.\n",
      "22841333: If you favor wireless features and comfort over sound quality, these are a great option. I was reluctant to drop $80 (which is what they cost when I bought them) on a pair of headphones as you can get a wired set that blows these specs away for a similar price if you shop around.  $80 isn't cheap.  I caved when I saw an online friend raving about them, so I went ahead and picked them up from here.First impression:  Super cool packaging. Simplistic set up.  Mic is built into the headset which gives them a sleeker, less bulky look than your high end sets normally would.  They come off a little cheapo and plastic if that makes sense at first but it all works out for comfort as I'll get into later.Setup: Only used it on PS4 so far but I've used it extensively on PS4 and the set was a breeze to get working.  All of the instructions provided are simple and easy to use.Comfort: The cheapo plastic feel works for comfort haha.  These are very light on the head, to the point I don't feel like I'm wearing them sometimes.  I have a slightly wider than normal head and they ARE a touch tight on me but I almost enjoy the feel.  They feel firm and in place.  Not tight and uncomfortable.  I'm not really doing justice to how comfortable these headphones are.  I have used the headset for about 6 weeks now including some pretty length sessions and these never felt too heavy or caused me any pain or discomfort at all.  It is probably the set's best feature.Sound: This is a stereo headset with &#34;virtual surround sound&#34; which works.  The quality isn't breathtaking.  For the same price you can do much much better from a sound quality standpoint.  You can get nice true surround sound sets with great quality but unless you're entering the $200+ range, generally speaking, you're dealing with wires.  Higher end wireless headsets like AstroA50 will slaughter these on quality, but they're also A LOT more expensive.  Another thing to mention is the in game chat/sound balance, which is actually pretty good and there are buttons toadjust them on the fly.Microphone: Not great. None of my friends have complained or anything but based on what I've seen googling around for mic tests, this mic is far from the best option available.  When plugged in wired, the mic does fine but when used wirelessly it's actually fairly muddy.  It uses wireless usb dongle on your PS4 so that's an issue.  Bluetooth would have been preferred but it's solid and works so I can't complain.  But for an $80 headset... maybe I expected a little more.Battery Life: 6-8 hours is what's listed.  I'd say it works out to about just under 8 hours when I use them.  It uses the same cord your PS4 controllers use to charge, which is a a huge plus.  Especially considering the wireless dongle takes up a USB spot.Convenience: I was surprised at how versatile this headset was.  It comes with a standard headphone cable you can plug into anything with a headphone jack.  So it works for not only PS Vita but (at least for audio purposes) presumably any portable gaming system, laptop, tablet, phone, etc that uses a headphone jack.  I haven't tried it yet but I heard that the USB wireless dongle works with PC.Functionality: The buttons were a hassle to get used to for me personally.  Everything is kind of awkward to get at on the side of your face.  You almost need to practice with them in single player so you know where your mute and volume buttons are on the fly.Final thoughts: This headset stands out on two things: 1) Comfort 2) It's wireless.  If you don't mind sacrificing sound quality for these two things this is an EXCELLENT value.  If you're not a huge audiophile this is probably a better option than more expensive sets, as the sound quality difference won't be huge to you but the comfort would.\n",

      "15787628: Simulated 7.1 surround sound. Amazing Glacier White limited edition. Great product. Used it playing Destiny game and Netflix.

Built in mic works very good during game play and seems work really well when plugged in on my Macbook. When battery charge runs out. The cable can be plugged in with the ps4 controller for extended okay. Headphone battery last about four to five  hours of game play or Netflix before needing a recharge.\n",

      "13289306: Do yourself a favor and buy these This headset is fantastic. I recently bought a PS4 and had been on the market for a (wireless) headset for a couple of weeks. After reading tons of reviews of various headsets,  I went with the Turtle Beach PX4s despite a lot of poor feedback, but after trying them out I was really disappointed so I returned them. I had read a lot about the Golds, but was kind of turned off by them due to the poor reviews of the mic quality, which is a big thing for me. Well, the day came that I went to buy my PS4 and I didn't want to NOT get a nice headset, so I decided to go with these on a whim - expecting that I would be taking them back within a day or two. Nope - not anymore. I have no plans on returning these. The value to quality ratio is amazing with these and I'm so glad that I gave them a try because I would have been missing out.My overall ratings:Comfort: 8.5/10These are extremely comfortable. The only gripe that I really have - and this is more personal - is that I typically prefer headsets that completely cup the ears. These just lay over the ears, which is fine for a lot of people. I thought that this would be a problem for me, but after really giving them a shot for 3 hours or so, I realized that I don't even notice it. In fact, I don't even really realize that I'm wearing them. The padding is really comfortable and would most likely maintain it's comfort for people doing longer gaming sessions.Sound: 8.5/10The sound on these is nothing short of amazing. The 7.1 really brings a lot to the gaming experience. The sound is incredibly crisp/clear, and just as much powerful. The only thing I noticed is that the bass could be more powerful. I personally like really heavy bass. That's not to say that the bass on these isn't good, but it's not as strong as I typically like. Still though, just know that you're going to be extremely happy with the sound of these.Mic: 7/10I think this is where these lack the most, and while it's not as horrible as people make it out to be, it's also not as good as it should be. If the mic was just a bit better on these, I would go as far to say that these are absolutely the best headset for under $200. Now, I've heard Youtube mic tests of these, and some of them are just unbearable. But when I tested mine through the PS4 (creating a voice message to someone and just replaying it), it actually wasn't too bad. Sure, it could be improved, and it did kind of have that &#34;tin can&#34; sound to it, but I heard my voice loudly and clearly. So, yeah, the mic could be improved, but it's no reason to turn your head in another direction.Battery Life: -Unfortunately, I can't comment much on the battery life. I gamed for 2-3 hours with these, surround sound on and everything, not even fully charged, and I still have 3 bars of battery when I was done. So from what I've seen, the battery life is nice.Ease of use: 8/10Overall, these things are pretty self explanatory. The directions are clear (for the most part) and the button layout on the headset is nice. I prefer sliders for volume adjustment, but these have buttons. Not a big deal honestly, but sometimes a slider for volumes is just nicer to know where you're at. One thing that I really liked about these, however, is that they are completely wireless. It's literally just: plug in the USB, and turn on the headset. That's it. There's none of this plug-into-the-controller stuff. Also, one thing I noticed is that the mini-USB chord is really small, so you won't be able to charge these and play at the same time if you plan on using that chord. However, it's just a mini-USB. I just use a longer chord that I have laying around, so this doesn't affect me.Overall, if you're looking for a really great wireless headset for a PS4 (or PS3), go with these. You're going to be happy with your decision, and you're going to get a lot more quality for the price.\n",

This headset is also very comfortable for a moderate amount of time (2-3 hours) after that it can get a bit sore but a short break fixes that. It is also extremely easy to connect, literally just plug in the USB and you're good to go. Battery life is also pretty good on a full charge it can be around 5+ hours but this can vary. The only Thing I can say negative about it is that if it runs out of battery the charger is extremely short so it can't be used while charging. However the controller charge cable also works for this.\n",

      "26584461: READ THIS BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY!!!! I would think that being from the same company that makes the game this headset would be flawless, however i was mistaken.This headset went bad after only one month..Dont get me wong the sound quality is amazing and although it isnt truly 7.0 suround sound it still works great and sounds soo close you wont even know the difference. After that first month tho something went wrong with the mic and people could barely hear me and i had to speak loudly for them to hear me. The sound coming from it was still awesome but what on earth happened to the mic? I called playstation support and after over an hour and a dropped call finally came to the conclusion that mic was bad and had to turn it in for service which was to be free under the warranty..Problem is I had to pay out of pocket for shipping and handling fees. One thing too when talking to the customer service rep he told me why dont I use it with the line plugged in which during troubleshooting did work which proved that it was a software problem.I still thought that, that was just a stupid thing to say because why would i spend almost 100 bucks on a wireless mic only to use it wired when i could get a wired suround sound mic from turtle beach for only 60 bucks. I thought that was just rude. I been doing some research online and it seems like this headset has been having the same issues with many other customers. Here is a link to a site to probably what you will be experiencing if you do have problems with the headset (http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-Peripherals-Support/Sony-GOLD-Wireless-Headset-WARNING/td-p/42979515) If you buy it I would strongly recommend that there is a good return/exchange/refund policy with the seller. Otherwise dont risk it..Just spend a little more and buy some turtle beaches..I rate this headset as 4 stars when it did work plus for the price however due to playstations customer service practices/policies and the fact that it went bad after only a month i bump it down toa 2 I would not recommend this headset to anyone buying it without at least a 90 day return/refund warantee.\n",

      "27386098: Great price for a diverse set of Wireless Headphones! **UPDATE 12-21-15**Today these headphones finally broke. The left earcuff broke about a month ago, today it broke completely off. These were my favorite headphones :( I never used the folding option, never had dropped them either.Based on their lifespan I will buy another pair.**ORIGINAL REVIEW**So far I have used these with: The Last Of Us Remastered, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition, and some GTA V. What I can say first is: I charged them when I got them: Last Wednesday, September 11, 2014. I've yet to recharge them (As of September 25, 2014). The initial 2 hr charge is still holding  However, i've only used them for a few hours. But it's good to know they last this long even on standby mode with an hour here and there of use,Comfort: They are a bit snug, but not overly so. Taking a moment to re-adjust the headset makes them comfortable. They work flawlessly with the ps3 and ps4 via the wireless adapter, movies, music and games all work with them.Now: Audio quality: It should be noted that for the last 20 or so years I've had a &#34;true&#34; surround sound system with 5 actual speakers in my room, until 6.1, and 7.1 surround sound came out, now I've got 7 physical speakers in my room all booming sound. I'm used to TRUE surround sound, not artificial &#34;simulated&#34; surround from two speakers trying to give off the illusion of actual, physical speakers... on this level I think the &#34;Stereo 7.1 (simulated) surround sound&#34; part of the headset fails. To me the surround sound sounds like stereo, left and right. However, the quality is not bad. Bass is fairly decent (especially after using the console's app to customize base, treble and other levels). Sound is crisp and is loud on high notes and comfortable on low notes. From booms to whispers: it's quite well heard. This is something my expensive (well, ok, only about $700.00, but still expensive for me, lol) true surround sound system can't do. It's great for day time and etc. but it's dynamic level isn't friendly for night-time listening where you want to hear whispers as loud as the booms: this is why I got the headset.I've also tried them with my Tablet, it works fantastically. While I can't use the wireless feature, I used it's very nice adapter to plug into my Tablet like a normal headset. As I'm typing this, I'm using it WIRELESSLY on my computer (windows 7). I simply plugged in the sony wireless dongle and Windows installed it perfectly! No cords, wireless 7.1 simulated output! On top of that: The built-in wireless mic also works for my pc! Which will move me onto the last section:Microphone: The built-in mic works great, it seems to pick up my voice even at a whisper, so far it sounds great, you can also adjust how loud you hear the game, and how loud people's voice come in. You can have voice very low, and the game up loud, or vice-versa as well as a balance between the two. I'd say it was worth the $91.90 bucks (that is after tax, free shipping). The huge bonus to me as a PC gamer in addition to console gaming is they worked flawlessly out of the box as a wireless mic and headset for pc! Even my capture cards picked up my &#34;usb recording device&#34; and &#34;USB audio device&#34; for youtube vids, and streaming. Over-all rating: Well worth the price!Last note: Have to keep using them to see when they will die out completely and be need to be charged up again. lol.\n",

We were past the Amazon  warranty. I contacted Sony. They warranty this hinge break for a year with a printed proof of sale easy from Amazon's purchase history. I paid to ship,(14$), in under a week, I had brand new pair! Sony has great customer service, just like Amazon.!   Amazing sound, sturdy. Fold to a more portable size. My 13 year old blows through headphones like tissue, but he has had these for three or four months, and they look and work like new.Throws them in his backpack all day at school, and no problems!! Best feature is the foldable sides. The headphone cushion comes off for cleaning or replacement. Great! Lasting longer than Turtle Beach for less $$\n",

      "47147029: Good stuff Great headset, setup was simple, has good surround sound. Only thing I don't like is that their noise canceling so if people walk up behind me and show up or touch me out of nowhere it scares the pudding out of me.\n",
      "40690361: Great overall Very happy with the overall sound quality, wireless functionality, and battery life. The headset battery lasts much longer than the battery in the controller itself, probably 2-3 times as long. One small con is that you cannot control voice chat and game volume separately as I was able to with gaming headsets that I previously owned. Occasionally I found it was slightly more difficult to hear my friends in chat than I would like, but this is just a minor complaint when considering sound quality as a whole, which is very good.\n",

      "26529560: Best cans for the money. I bought these headphones specifically for playing 'Destiny' into the wee hours of the morning and not pissing my wife off by cranking the home theater at 2:00AM. The sound is really amazing for sub-$100 phones. Bass response is good and the virtual 7.1 channel surround is quite impressive.

Wow, the only time i'm not using this headset is at the gym... not because i can't, but because i dont want to get them all sweaty. I love these things, makes it great to hear sound my playstation (and works with Xbox One) makes and its assumed but unconfirmed to work for macs/pc and tvs (because it connects wirelessly with usb). it also comes with a wire to manually connect to any device with a headphones/mic port. The best headphones on the market. Easily worth $150-200. thus a steal at anything under $100. a bunch of great easily accessible modes/functions right on the the headset. Volume (duh), Volume to switch Chat/Game Sound Ratio, SurroundSound button, switch from off/1/2 for two different settings that you can adjust with the free Companion App.ONE OF THE FIRST ACCESSORIES YOU SHOULD BUY\n",
      "10376731: Five Stars Love these i have no complaints\n",
      "51827249: Comfortable and well worth the price I have the Pulse Elite Wireless headset but was given the Gold. I find the Gold to be much more comfortable and don't miss the rumble feature in the Pulse much. The biggest problem I had with the Pulse Elite is the double head band pressure on the top of the head and on my ears. After a couple of hours it would give me a nasty headache and I have an average size head, 7 1/4 hat size. I don't have that with the Gold and wear them for hours and hours with little problem.  The sound is very good, though not a set audiophiles would turn to for quality music listening.\n",
      "2585724: Very good design, it's easy to wear and it's confortable Very good design, it's easy to wear and it's confortable!  Also have a very good range of distance. I used on my computer and PS4, there is only one downside for me, when you use the cable is not as loud as when with wireless and I would like to use on my PS VITA but still there is no connection to it by wireless. Still a good one though, I recommend!\n",
      "19751022: Great value Unbeatable value. Only minor complaint is the bass could be better, but it's really pretty good and the headphones are crystal clear.\n",
      "13276774: Not enough room in the cans, and don't breathe well. Most people like these headphones, but can't advise these over the Elites easily. I think the Elites would bother me for the same reasons the Golds do.  These headphones were a great idea. I'm gonna check out the wired Silver version that's expected in late December. (you can preorder now on Amazon)  I dig actual 5.1 speaker setups and headphones with virtual surround alike. The PS4 Golds are lightweight, good sounding, virtual surround headphones. I wanted to like them. I bought them, tried them, and after two sessions, my ears were sore and hot. Right now, I'm using Sennheiser HD558's with the Turtle Beach DSS2. That's around $170 total. Much more than a PS4 Gold investment.   Now, these Sennheisers, although not the most expensive Senn's, are unreal. I would say, \\\\\"I guess you pay for comfort.\\\\\", but I've had much less expensive Turtle Beaches that are more comfortable than the Golds.  Comfort is subjective, so if they're comfortable to you, then they're comfortable, but I had the same problem some other folks mention in forums and youtube vids. Not enough room in the cans.  The speakers press too hard on my ears. Just make sure you get in a couple hour gaming sessions right when you get them, so you'll have time to send them back.  If these things had breatheable earcup material and more room in the cans, I'd have kept them. Other than those two things, they're plenty good wireless virtual surrounds.  Note* I didn't try the mic. Not multiplayer gaming right now.\n",

      "20343555: I recommend Great for ps4 I own px21 turtle beaches and Triton 7.1 and all are good but the wireless aspect of the golds gives them a one up on the others mentioned not great on the bass end but overall good crisp sign really directional far as surround I can easily tell where gunfire is coming from when playing shooters and explosions are intense seem sturdy and pretty durable. But not the most durable comfortable. I use mine for hours and often forget that I am wearing them battery is decent you can get quite a few hours before you get the low battery alert pretty good sound suppression but on a scale of 1-10 1 being no suppression. And ten being total suppression I give them a 7 the Bluetooth has good range I went upstairs of my apartment and maintained connection so 5 stars from me made me connect my Triton 7.1 to my xb1. For better sound quality then I was getting from other sound system great for 80$\n",
      "19392174: Awesome sound and is comfortable unlike the pulse edition Awesome sound and is comfortable unlike the pulse edition. This is essientally a remake of the original wireless headset that Sony made. The only difference is that the mic is worse since its hidden in the earcup whereas the original had it extend out. This headset however allows access to the companion app on the ps4/ps3 which lets you have custom profiles for different games.4/5 stars since the microphone is pretty bad.Sound quality is a 5/5 however.\n",
      "17862984: Great set for a great price! We purchased these because my husband plays games after the kids go to bed and they wake very easily (as do I). Sound quality was excellent, microphone worked well, and they were comfortable to wear. It took a couple minutes to figure out settings for ps4 but it wasn't bad.Both my husband and I are happy with this purchase. I'm especially happy he didn't buy the $300 set.\n",

      "24504426: plastic crap. While the audio sounds amazing with these, it cannot make up for the horrible quality of the headset themselves.It is made from a very light cheap plastic and one week into owning them, they snapped when putting them on normally.I do have a rather larger head, but they should take into account for bending when putting them on.my ps3 headset (which I had to go back to using) had a metal band across the top and made it impossible for the headset to snap from over bending while putting them on.overall, they are great if they were just like $30, but not for $100. they should be a lot more sturdy for the price that they are.\n",
      "22273163: awesome!  2 minor issues keep it from getting a 5 They work awesome for the PS4 They mostly work on the PC  Incredible sound.  I found out i was wearing them backwards when i tried to use the microphone.  Minor dislikes that kept me from giving it a 5: When you adjust a setting such as the volume, there is a very loud beep which hurts my ears. When i use them on the PC they work for DiabloIII very well, but if i try to watch videos on youtube or vevo.com, I only get sound in one ear. I like them enough i would still recommend them highly unless you watch a lot of PC videos.\n",

Just remember you have to put them on correctly or no on can here you due to mic placement. It's great that it works so well without that goofy mic being right in your face like on other head sets. They're comfy either way but they fit best when on correctly so you should know if you have them on wrong.\n",
      "47655133: Must have for Gaming and Movie enthusiasts!!! Pros: Considering getting a second pair for my office. Way better sound and feeling than most Beats Ive had and more comfortable than most Turtlebeach sets. Definitely one of the best Over-Ear headphones out there.1. The earmuffs are over ear, they dont make contact with your ear at all, they rest over the side of your head very comfortably, which adds the fact that your ears dont hurt after extended use.Has a inverted &#34;D&#34; shape for you ear to fit perfectly without toughing the walls of the earmuff. I wear glasses and there´s no awkward feeling also. Leading to awesome surround sound.2. Battery Life lasts about the same as a ps4 controller, I used it frequently for 6 hours nonstop (i blame Diablo 3) and still about 20-25% life left.3. Wireless reciever works flawlessly, no audio delay at all, about 15 feet distance you begin to feel the audio loss. Specially if you have concret walls on your house( like movin around to the closet or bathroom, if you´re lazy enough to not take them off). Plug and Play with PS4, PS3 and Laptops(PC, dont have a MAC to test it)4. Works great with the included male to male 3.5 mm cable, the plus is that they dont have to be ON for it to work with your cellphone, tablet, ipad, etc.5. Chat/mic works normal( i dont chat alot).5. Very light, after a while you dont even feel them on you.Cons: Has a lot of cons, but still makes it a must have set if you´re into lots of Gaming and Movies.1. Very Light. Very plastic-like feeling. Making it not at all scratch resistant.2. The 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable included should have been better quality. Looks very cheap.3. Wireless mode DOES NOT WORK with the PS VITA( that is a big no no, maybe on a future update). You have to use a cable.4. The ON light kinda bugs if you´re on a dark room, like watching a movie and stuff.5. The app is very simple to use but, doesnt offer much on sound profiles. Specially ifyou dont own the games to which it has available profiles.\n",
      "12084244: Gold qualty for the price of tin... When i opened the package i was pleased with how it was sorted, and all the cables and carrying pouch it came with, and more so with the fact that they've updated the charge port.  I've let the device charge and immediately went to try it on some sound heavy games and was impressed with the quality of sound it produced and the ability to chat in game with other players, for the price and the fact you can use this on the vita, and other portable media devices i say its worth it\n",

      "51429051: PS3 & PS4 Gamers looking for a great headset, look no further!!! I am not one to write reviews, nor am I generally one to buy into expensive wireless headsets. . . but being a gamer dad with kids who have a bed time. . . I needed to keep my unwind time with games at night quieter.  I took the plunge and got this on a sale and it has been one of the best gaming investments I have made!  The sound quality is incredible!  You wouldn't even know these are wireless they sound so good!  Some reviewers say the mic is low or crackly, and I have to say that has not been the case with my tests and trials.  I have set this up on both my ps3 and ps4 and even tried it on my pc and all of those systems have been plug n play and nothing but clarity!  The battery life is also excellent.  I've had 6 hour gaming sessions and still had plenty of power left in these!The only thing I dislike about these headphones as they are very form fitting and padded, and tend to make your ears sweat a bit, but this hasn't really created a negative experience and it's not that noticeable until you pull em off and you realize your ears have been melting inside them, haha!Keeping this short and sweet. .  . in the grand scheme of things and comparing them to the other wireless offerings and overall quality of this headset. . it gets a 5 stars across the board!GET THESE AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!\n",

      "45693478: Very good headset, only a few gripes The PlayStation Gold Wireless Stereo headset is a good-to-great headset. It comes with a USB dongle you can plug it in to your PS4 or PC and it will work as intended. The audio quality is fairly impressive, but the microphone quality lands somewhere in the middle of &#34;good enough&#34;. My main gripe is the removable faceplates keep falling off and the USB dongle is required for use on the PS4 instead of using BlueTooth; since the PS4 does not have any rear USB ports, the dongle is a little bit of a blemish on the front of your shiny new console. Other than that, it is a very good headset for playing games with. You can pipe both game and chat audio (or just chat audio) to the headphones through the PS4 settings.Bottom line: If you're looking for the best wireless headset for the PS4, this is it. Mostly because Sony limited the BlueTooth to very few Sony made products and 3rd party wireless ones are few and far between, so this is basically one of your only options for wireless headsets. Even though your options are limited, this is a very good headset.\n",
      "33574738: Five Stars sound is amazing they are good build\n",
      "43238024: Excellent sound and comfort I bought these for Destiny Fireteam chat. So far, I love them.  They're RF wireless, not Bluetooth, so a USB recover must be plugged into the PS4 for the headphones to work. The headphones fit very comfortably, even after hours of wear. The sound is awesome. This is how a surround  sound virtual environment is supposed to sound.  I literally found myself taking the headphones off at times to verify the noises I heard were from the headset and not the room around me. That's how distinct and isolated each individual sound was at times.  There is a free companion app that you can download from the Playstation store that allows you to load custom sound profiles into the second sound setting (the headphones have two settings: setting one is default and setting 2 can be a game profile or the default bass boost profile). I downloaded the Destiny profile and the game sounds great.  Signal distance is very good. I walked into an adjoining room wearing the headphones and never lost sound.  The left-cup has volume controls and a mute button that are easy and intuitive to use. I wish the charging cable were a little longer; it's a tad under a foot long.  Otherwise, love them!\n",
      "31145218: Good Stuff I have had every version of headphones that has been officially been released by Playstation, these are the best ones yet.  Sony has improved each product tremendously with each release.\n",
      "37954337: Great sound and amazing comfort I've been using these for a couple weeks now, and I am very impressed.  They were easy to set-up, literally just plug and play.  They are comfortable and can be worn for hours.  The sound is amazing! I know some people feel it can use more bass, or they dislike it doesn't have the pulse feature, but really, do you want your head shaking for hours on end? If you use the developer created profiles for games, they are amazing. Destiny sounds great on this headset!\n",
      "27557027: Others complaints unwarranted I'm not sure about these other reviews, but I have had mine since the were released and they have been fantastic! I use them on my ps3, ps4, PC, vita, and phone (for music). It is all wirelessly as long as you can use a USB. Sound is good but not overpowering. Bass is is lower than normal but anyone that's not an audiophile shouldn't complain about. My daughter gets ahold of them from time to time and she hasn't broke them yet.I've had turtle beaches and Astros, for $100 you can't beat this headset. If for some reason yours don't work properly, get replacements because mine have been great. It's more than worth the wait for shipping.\n",
      "14771693: Worth it I admit that I have not owned many stereo headsets in the past. I usually get by with cheap headsets or iPod ear-buds. That said I am very pleased with this headset. I have been using the product for about 2 months now. I wanted something to replace the ear-bud that came with the PS4 because it kept falling out of my big ears. The sound quality is great, and for the price I could not have asked for more. It's a little awkward to use at first because of all of the buttons and you have to learn that some of them you can tap and hold for different effects. I keep it charged pretty regularly and generally use it 4 to 6 hours at a time. It has not died on me yet. I can't tell exactly where the internal microphone is, but none of my friends have complained about hearing or understanding me. I wear glasses and I have found that I sort of have to put them over the top of the ear phones in a particular way, otherwise I will get a headache from the headset pressing my glasses against the side of my head. However, a friend also has this headset and wears glasses and has told me he has no such trouble.\n",
      "10438245: Five Stars Great headset. Very clear sound and it gets loud in your ears great headset for the price.\n",
      "3016967: Four Stars A little uncomfortable for long gaming sessions\n",
      "44952483: Sony hit the mark in quality and universal compatibility. Sony has done a nice job on this headset. Overall the build quality seems good, it doesn't feel flimsy and as others have said this headset is very comfortable. The sound quality isn't the best you can get but it is definitely good enough for most people and is light years ahead of any TV speakers or cheap surround sound system. It even competes very well with my full out home theater system which cost nearly 20x more. The sound is crisp and clear, although lacking a bit in the mid range at times. Low frequencies also come through clearly even at maximum volume levels. I haven't had a problem with battery life yet and wireless range is excellent.For a headset that was designed to be used with the Playstation consoles, this headset is surprisingly compatible with other systems. I connected it to my Windows 7 PC without an issue and even managed complete plug and play compatibility with my Linux Ubuntu 13.04 laptop. Plug it into your PC and switch the audio output device to the wireless headset and your good to go. Getting the microphone to work with a PC is just as easy. Sony also providing a standard 3.5mm jack adds further functionality as it can be connected to nearly every device you can think of. The only disadvantage of using this headset on devices other than a Playstation would be the fact that you don't get the. Best you can get in that case is with the built in Windows VSS if you set it in the device properties on your PC.A piece of advice to anyone having problems with the audio cutting out, make sure you don't have any other wireless devices directly next to the dongle. This headset is not bluetooth and works on the 2.4 gHz wireless frequency which is the same as many wireless routers, keyboards and mice. I had this problem and it turned out to be caused by plugging the dongle into a USB port directly next to my keyboard/mouse dongle. I moved the headset dongle and no problems with sound quality up to 25 feet away.\n",

I just received it today, and as soon as I got it I instantly uploaded the Watch_Dogs files to it using the Headset companion app, and started the game. Watch_Dogs sounded amazing in it, it felt like I was actually in the game. I wonder what a VR could do in future along with this headset!\n",

      "24115736: The sound quality is fantastic for a gaming set up and you can adjust ... I got this headset for my boyfriend's birthday this year. The sound quality is fantastic for a gaming set up and you can adjust accordingly for your volume preferences right on the headset, which is a nice feature when you're mid-game. It's been a fantastic addition to our PlayStation and my boyfriend loves to use it for his shooter games. I normally like to sleep in on the weekends and he'll put on the headphones so he can play his game without disrupting me with explosive sounds. It's awesome. Try them out!\n",

I have a pair of 'Beats Pros' that I've been using for years and now I've started using the Gold Headset for everything except music production.

      "15652389: a must for late night gamers I am a late night gamer and this product is a must, super easy to setup, literally just plug the usb wireless adapter into your PS3 or PS4 and done.  not very noise cancelling but can be loud if you want it loud.  Great product\n",

The sound quality is awesome! They are light and comfortable despite the size. If you a reused to ear buds like me you may be a bit hesitant to buy these but do yourself (and your gaming experience) a favor and buy these. I originally wanted the white ones to match the white Destiny PS4 but the black ones were $20 bucks less at the time so i bought those and have no regrets... I can't see them while I wear them.The surround sound is so clear I use i can use it to hunt enemies by sound and am less reliant on the in game maps.\n",
      "34359004: Overpriced Comfortable PS4 Friendly Headphones :) The major downfall for these headphones is that Sony has made them wireless only when using the PS4, or when you want to plug the usb stick (receiver) into a pc. They are not bluetooth, so no wireless connection elsewhere, but they can be used as wired headphones if needed. My only other gripe with them is that they feel a bit cheap (at the hinges mostly), like one should handle with care.On the other hand, these are downright amazing for the PS4. If you have plugged headphones into the Dualshock 4 you know that the sound result is fair at best. These, being completely wireless, sound AMAZING for games. Surround sound is so much clearer than any speaker setup I have heard previously, and the sound quality itself is also pretty damn good (though it lacks the bass of other more expensive headphones). They are comfortable enough to wear for a few hours, and the battery is hardy enough to last that long.All in all, at full price these are probably not worth the money (unless you will always use them). They really wind up being a luxury device when you cannot have the TV turned up for games.\n",
      "7531785: Excellent headset! !!! Excellent headset love the surround sound ability.  As well as the ability to have more chat and less game sound and vice versa.\n",
      "24212407: I was extremely surprised at how great these headphones worked and sat on my head I am not a big fan of headphones, so I was very hesitant to purchase these headphones.  I was extremely surprised at how great these headphones worked and sat on my head.  I would highly recommend these headphones to any gamer.  The sound and clarity is great during gameplay is awesome!\n",
      "3711642: Good Features, cool 7.1 surround sound, but bass is lacking. I really tried to like these enough to keep them. The features were great and the 7.1 surround sound was very cool, but the main complaint, and this is a big one, is that there was hardly any bass at all. If you are looking for a good deep sounding bass, don't get these. Even with the Xtra Bass option, my guns were sounding like Pew Pew, instead of BOOM BOOM.  I hooked up my 5 year old Sony XB500 headphones to my PS4 controller and they sounded WAY better. So if you don't mind that much bass, then these will be good for you. But for me.... I just need more BOOM.\n",

      "25603885: Five Stars Very good for the price and love the battery life\n",
      "13750236: Overall, A great choice and worth your money. First off, this is my first ever wireless headset, so i can't really compare them to any other headset.    Build Quality:  Yes... this is made out of plastic and does feel like it could snap if you over stretch them, but only time will tell if they withstand in the long run. Still they do sit comfortably on your head, with the ability of adjusting the ear phones themselves.    Sound Quality:  Again, i cannot match this to any other head phone set. The sound is not bad as you do get surround sound, but the bass is not all that great. It's just missing that Bass depth. Still, i can say that the sound of character voices and machine gun fire sound great.  sound around you will leak in a bit, but whether or not this will bother you depends on you and you alone. I personally like being able to hear someone enter the room behind me, hear the phone or the door ( although the door will be heard if its being kicked, not softly knocked on :)  )  These are great for watching movies and gaming.  Have not tested the Mic (chat) option yet, although i wont be using it most likely.    Appearance:  Not that these are meant as a fashion statement, some people care how their headphones look on them (not me). Still, these headphones look very nice.  The Mic is hidden within the head piece itself, so you wont have that sticking out if front of you, which is a major plus in my opinion.    Conclusion:  All in all, I'm very happy with these headphones. In comparison to other wireless headphones Prices out there, You get a lot for $80. They Are easy to adjust, sound great with the exception of the low Bass, and look great as well.  I would recommend to anyone that is simply looking for a good wireless headset \\\\\"fix\\\\\". :)\n",

      "1319397: Versatile Headsets They are the best headsets I've ever had, the built quality makes it feel durable and not cheap, I love the wireless feature because it's the best thing to have while playing and you want to feel free to move around and even walk away to get more coffee, the sound quality is perfect for a normal person that just wants the game sound right in your head without bothering other with it, and sometimes the sound quality makes me scared because it becomes so real that I think it's in the real world xD last but not least I also use them on my computer with the cable it came with and what's amazing is that they don't need to be on to work so you can save charge for later.... since I got them I don't regret buying them :)\n",
      "23098911: Nice headset! Good sound quality but a little heavy weight! Nice sound quality... I just think it's a little heavy and after a few hours not too comfortable for my ears.\n",
      "10348776: Excellent product. Very easy to set up and sounds ... Excellent product. Very easy to set up and sounds nice and clear, the perfect product for the needs that I have. I picked these up to be able to watch my blu rays while the wife is asleep because I have gotten so use to the surround sound I can no longer go back to TV speakers. These are great for gaming on the PS4 and PS3 and the Vita. Do not hesitate to pick these up they are a steal and the companion app on the ps4 is a nice touch as well to be able to cater to each of these new current gen games.I will say the bass isnt as booming as I would like but I guess nothing can replace a real surround sound set up.\n",
      "26663319: Not Bad, Great for what you're paying for! It sounds great, the volume is kind of low compared to some other headphones I've had but repositioning them is important to get better sound into the ear. But regardless I'm very happy with my purchase, I have yet to use the mic but hopefully it's good and not crappy as some people say it is. Wish I could have waited for the platinum headset but I needed one asap!\n",

      "22672848: As if I've ever heard my PS4 sound before... It's like I've never heard any of the sound from my PS4 before, the sound quality compared to my tv speakers absolutely blew my mind. I saw some reviews that demonstrated the microphone not working very well but mine seems to come across crystal clear (tested by sending audio messages and listening back to them as well as via feedback from people in BF4).Very comfortable, no problems there... Haven't had them long enough to see if there are battery life problems but nothing failing yet.\n",
      "51758298: good, not great good. Not noise proof, greatsound, takes time to get used to buttons a little tight with adjustments.  Could have had more breathable material for ear pieces.  Concerned about the folding part.  The companion app is ok, would like more ways to customize.  I only play 2 to 4 hrs per week so meets my needs perfectly for the price.  Battery good\n",
      "15107899: Good battery life I'll keep the review simple, rather than be verbose.Pros:1. Good battery life. Apparently there are wireless headsets for the PS4 that have almost twice the length of battery time, but others are about half of this. So I'd say it's solid at 6-8hours, and it charges pretty quickly.2. It's compact enough for a full size headphone, because it folds up somewhat.3. It may look cheap, but it actually seems pretty durable.4. Audio quality is plenty good enough for gaming. This isn't an audiophile setup, and you're probably not listening to Beethoven on it.5. Connects easily. If you can't figure out how to make this work with your PS4, you might need to update your firmware. It's pretty much as simple as it gets.6. It's pretty inexpensive for a wireless headset, and if #5 is important, that's a big plus.Cons:1. It's not the most comfortable headset if you're above the age of 10. It's not that it's awful all around. It's just that it squeezes you a lot. That keeps them on firmly, and probably is good for children. The ear pads feel ok, and the headband is fine. It can stretch out vertically a fair bit, so no problems there for me. It's just like the worlds mildest vice grip on your head.2. The VSS and other gimmicks are worthless. Make sure to download the free Sony headphone app so you can adjust the #2 setting, as needed. The buttons are easy enough to use, but aside from the volume, they aren't really anything special.3. Someone decided to not make the dongle have a headphone input. That must be incredibly inexpensive, but they removed it in comparison to the pulse elite set (which I won't discuss as I don't have it, and don't want it). But what were they thinking. That's a huge let down that it's not essentially universally compatible with other devices. You can use it on a PC, but you can't just directly connect to whatever device you like that has a headphone or line out jack. Almost every wireless headset out there has this ability, and no the jack on the headphones itself isn't a replacement as then it's no longer wireless, which is why we're here.4. The microphone is pretty bad. Granted, it's sleek that it doesn't have a boom mic. It's also a terrible design flaw for anyone that is responsible with their headphones. This probably goes into the bonus category, if it's for a child. There isn't something to easily break off. Sadly it also means your voice chat will be far worse than a normal gaming headset that has a boom mic. I may test out if you can use the jack on the headset to attach something like the modmic, but probably won't bother sticking a $40 mic on an $80 headset anyways.Summation:1. It fits great for kids. If you're an adult, it may have a bit of an annoying vice like squeeze on your temples, but it's not horrible.2. It connects very easily to the PS4, but don't expect to use this for everything else. I haven't tried using it on the PC, mostly because of the mic (see #4).3. Battery life is reasonable. Not amazing, but certainly not bad. More than adequate for most people. I have no complaints, but it doesn't set any awards. If you game for 8 hours straight, it's probably time to go for a walk and let it charge anyways, as that's just not healthy.4. The mic is crummy, but see #1. At least it won't break off.5. The build quality looks cheap, but actually seems pretty sturdy.6. No need to plug into the controller for microphone use. It's built in with no extra wires needed, so it's true wire-free, unlike some competitors.7. If you plan to use this primarily for solo play, with a PS4, it's a great value for the price. I'd very much recommend it. If you plan on buying a headset for frequent voice communications, or want to get a headset that works universally with other devices, this is probably not your solution.I'm happy with mine, and don't regret the purchase at all,but I returned the second set (unopened), once I saw there were alternatives that would allow me to connect the TV, PC, and PS4, all at once, have a boom mic, and longer battery life./Audiophile, running AH-D7000's, with an external DAC and Amp, and a mod-mic, for PC use. Still happy enough with these for just killing time on the PS4, without using voice comms. For the price, and not a voice communication set, I think they have an excellent price point. If they had a boom mic, and an external input on the dongle, I'd rate them a 4.5 (price being a bonus).\n",

      "10013184: Great surroundsound headset with mic Great headset for the price, bought it since I wanted to have a mic for GTA V but didnt want to mess with more wires.  Everyone says I sound clear through the game so thats a plus.  Surround sound is pretty great I think.  They're light enough and the ear cones are pretty comfortable, my ears dont get sweaty like I would suspect.  The whole setup is plastic but feels like it could take a fall.  The earbuds fold in easily.  Battery life seems pretty good, get about 8 hours or so of use before they need a hour long recharge.\n",
      "52504995: Better than I was hoping! This headset is definitely worth the money! The sound quality it brings to your games is great. It's also not a bad set to use for your personal listening and a lot cheaper than Beats. I highly recommend these!\n",
      "49446406: These headphones are fantastic!! These headphones are fantastic!!! I was looking for something to game with that was wireless that had 7.1 surround. Originally i picked up the turtle beach px4 and though the sound is a lil more present and surround on that headset, i couldnt stand all the wires that were necessary to hook up. I returned the px4s, traded them for the sony golds and saved 30 bucks in the process.A lot of people arw saying that the bass is lacking from these headphones. I have to say that when i hooked up my these to my galaxy and jammed some body party by ciara. Trust me. Bass is not an issue!!! Im also an audio engineer that does prefer a low enf bassy sound.The point? A wireless 7.1 surround sound headset with custom audio profile for the last of us. These will not disapoint!!!!

Microphone is very bad my friends can't even hear me I end up using my cheap headphones that's came with it for talk most of the time  4. The range is so bad so you get a USB receiver no lie max distance is like 7 feet and that's pushing it if your at that's distance you will start getting s***ty quality sound and your friends won't be able to hear you as good\n",

Surround sound, plenty of bass (not sure what the complaints are) and they are very comfortable to wear. The voice chat also works amazingly well. I have nothing bad to say about these and I wish I would have purchased them sooner. They are great when I don't want to run the home theater system especially at night for the wife or kids.Playing Diablo 3 UUE today and I could not believe the ambiance and the quality of sound. 5 stars for now they are now. Let's hope they hold up and last for years. I don't see a problem with them lasting as long as you take care of the things you own.P.S. I actually think these sound as good if not slightly better than my way overpriced Turtle beach gaming headset and that says a lot to me.\n",

When I first put them on I actually was lifting them off to be sure the sound wasn't coming through my external surround sound thats how good they sound to me. Very clear, on setting 2 the bass is enough for me for sure but I'm an old guy so you how kids are.I love the hidden microphone as well since I hate boom style mics and this one works amazingly well.You can really hear nuances in game especially when you use the companion app and upload custom settings to them as you can do. That by itself was a really great feature to me. Can answer how they work with other devices since I will solely use them with my new PS4. Are there better ones out there ?? Sure if you want to spend 300 plus dollars there are. For me this are perfect. Highly recommended.\n",

USB into the PS4, PS3, and PC and connects instantly with the consoles so you can voice chat. The buttons on the side adjust volume and then voice chat volume so you can either hear your friends in party chat or the game. Comes with an aux cable to use with a headphone jack, haven't tried that yet, nor have I with my Vita. Battery life is great too along with sound quality. No boom mic is good also so nothing is in the way. Nearly 100% noise cancelling too. I got mine for about $75 when Amazon was doing some sale on it, but I would definitely pay full price if I needed a headset.\n",

      "22777277: Best product for the price PROS- Great sound quality for both playback and microphone sound. So your games sound great and your voice is loud and clear for everyone else.- Consistently comfortable once you figure out how to wear them. There's a curtain position I have to tilt the headset so that my dumbo ears don't hurt after 2+ hours of usage.- Lightweight and WIRELESS! If you're looking for great quality wireless headphones without digging too deep into your wallet this is your man.CONS- The main downside is definitely the battery life, but on the other hand it does keep me from playing on my pc for 4+ hours at a time. The recharge rate isn't too bad (wish I had stats for you)- The headset is uncomfortable after a while until you learn how to wear it like I said earlier- The ear pieces feel a bit rickety and not very well secured to the rest of the headset so I find myself questioning this product's time it will survive in my possessionOTHER THOUGHTSThis was my first headset and I'm very pleased with the quality after having TBx12s for about a year before I threw them away because they were 20% duct tape and beyond ruined. This is the best product I could find for the price and I don't find it to be &#34;cheap feeling&#34;\n",
      "39181797: Great for Rocksmith I bought this to play Rocksmith without driving my wife crazy.  My biggest concern was that the sound might have some lag.  I couldn't find any reviews online stating if this was an issue or not.  I was happy to find that there is no discernible lag between hitting a string on the guitar and hearing the sound.  They work great for Rocksmith.  Just make sure to turn off the mic, as it will pick up the sound from hitting the strings and play it back through the headphones.\n",
      "20277919: Good product, fair price First headset I've ever had. I have high standards, and this sounds great with video games and music (connects to iPhone). Build in mic works great and it's awesome that it doesn't have to jut out in front of your face to do so, which is what I always pictured headsets to be. Definitely a good buy.\n",

      "10953269: Great sound at a good value with excellent features. I'd like to preface this by stating that I was iffy as to whether the virtual surround sound would stack up with my analog Roccat Kave headset, I've been spoiled by the sound quality and the performance of those headphones, so much that I fought tooth and nail to find a solution to use them with my PS4, my options eventually came down to a sub five hundred dollar adapter and these, I'm happy to say that I am pleasantly surprised by the ease of use, sound quality and the directional accuracy that the virtual sound provides.I did not purchase this via Amazon although I have to say I really enjoy the headset and would recommend it for anyone looking for a wireless headset for the PS4. I would encourage everyone who buys this headset to download the PS$/3 app that allows you to choose equalizer settings as it can made a big difference in game, the stock sound is just fine although the headphones are capable of more than what is initially offered so those looking for the best possible sound out of these should explore the equalizer settings (which are transferred directly to the headset and can be used for standard music listening).\n",

Worth it! work great very nice sounds I used for my PS4 AND PC  with PC  doesn't support 7.1 but you can download Razer Surrounded Pro software for free it will allowed you to get the 7.1 surrounded for free and it works for any headset! I love those headset they had long battery life it will stay longer than 8 to 10 hours which is great! the MIC work well as well.\n",
      "45399271: Five Stars excellent thanks!\n",
      "28428037: Better than Astro, remarkable quality Kudos to Sony for making something so remarkable available so cheap.  I also own an Xbox One, and will be way more likely to buy games for the PS4 because of these.  My gaming experience has been upgraded significantly because I'm now so immersed in the world.  I almost didn't buy these because the pricier Astro wireless set kept cutting out due to interference with my router, which is also in the same room.  For some reason I haven't had that issue with these.  HIGHLY recommended.  These should be included with the PS4.\n",
      "15127752: Perfect for Sony Gaming Works perfectly with both my ps3 and my ps4, you just plug in the USB dongle into either system and then turn on the headset and it automatically switches your audio output to the headphones.  The headset also has a hidden microphone that captures very nice clear speech for online play.  For the price these are absolutely the best gaming headphones available on the market in my opinion\n",
      "2829890: You do not need to pay a lot for a headset.. Invest in this one Awesome!! Nice & comfortable.. You can hear everything\n",
      "26901528: Wait for Gen. 2  or buy a different bluetooth set. They work with ps4 which is a big deal when it came out. I assume other makes and models work now too. I am not too thrilled about the controls though. They seem wonky and you never really know if you mixer is balanced or if you are turning up your chat audio or your game.PS4 has a UI for their Sony brand headsets. How hard would it be to tell me where I am with the mixer and volume?Also the collapsibility is a joke. If anything it just feels like I have some headphones that broke and I duct taped them together. They don't full collapse into a compact mode. Hard to explain, but they are not like DJ headphones where you can make them tiny and shove them in a bag.Wireless range is pretty bad too, I miss my old free Socom ps3 headset range. It was bluetooth. I hate this RF dongle that uses one of my two usb ports on the ps4.\n",

The Mic is naturally sensitive so heavy breathers beware. My ears are big so I can't wear them for more than a few hours before getting sore or fatigued. But for the price, these have the greatest value.\n",

      "44174192: Looks cheap, feels cheap, marginal sound quality, cuts out during game play. Don't let the fanboys fool you, these are cheap cans and you know it every time you put them on.  Construction is very lightweight and chintzy, they're ugly, and worst of all they randomly cut out during game play.  They're wireless, which is nice, but other than that these are really pretty lousy headphones.  Bass is VERY thin and unconvincing, they're not very comfortable at all and again... they randomly cut out during game play.    The amount of ambient noise that comes in while you wear these is another tremendously weak area.  You can clearly hear everything going on in the room around you, really it's barely different than not wearing headphones at all, so if you live in a loud environment you will NOT be able to use these for gaming as the ambient noise will entirely interfere with your gaming.    And once again.. they randomly cut out during game play.  You'll be cruising along doing your thing and then suddenly there's just complete silence for 3 to 8 seconds.  Happens about every 5 minutes or so, though not with any regularity.    Also, no stand, and to charge them you have to plug in a fiddly little micro-USB cable.    I got suckered in by the rave reviews of this headset, don't let it happen to you.  For the $80 these go for on Amazon I guess they're tolerable, but I sure wish I'd gone ahead and bought something much nicer.\n",

The battery life is as advertised about 8 hours.  The surround sound works well in games (mostly cod ghosts) and with movies.  On PS4 you get an app off the store which allows you to set up a custom EQ setting if your into that sort of thing, and if your not they have presets to choose from.The headband is comfy and while you have it on your head it seems to prevent the size adjustment from moving so you cant screw it up while its on.  It has removable face plates on the ends of the headband and I think I would be interested in buying a neat design for it if such a thing were available but I cant find any.Very happy with this product and wish I would have gotten them sooner.\n",
      "4209714: No one can sneak without making a sound. They are defiantly gaming oriented. I use them with my ps vita and on my gaming PC. Whenever I'm playing crysis 3 or counter strike I always am aware of my surroundings because I can hear the footsteps very well. They are comfortable and provide good bass if you configure a good equalizer setting if your on PC or ps4. The wireless works on PC and ps4 pretty well, the mic works best when wired in. I definitely say go for gold and get this headset if you love play station and want an affordable headset that let's you get the advantage over your opponent(s). Stay frosty!\n",

      "14641814: Five Stars AWESOME\n",
      "18302485: Really Good headset Overall this headset is great, they're worth buying for $79.99 or the recent price $99.99, they're only wireless for PS3 and PS4, because it's made for the consoles, the sound quality sounds really nice, the battery life lasts 6 to 8hrs. They're very simple to figure out, they're extremely comfortable. They weigh about 2lbs, so they're not too heavy on your head. They stay on all the time when they are wired to a PC, Mac, mobile device, the microphone quality sounds decent and they fold up and they come with a travel bag, so they're very travel wise. Charging takes about an hour, but you can still use them wirelessly when they are charging, and you can any micro usb charger. Overall this headset is really good, they're totally worth buying, so I highly recommend you buy this headset.\n",
      "25742327: great head phones for any gamer. These are great good sound the mic is okay its nice to be able to customise the settings with the companion app. Not to mention its awesome when you live in an appartment ornjust want to keep it quiet\n",

Comfort wise I am not as big a fan, I have a smaller head and they feel a bit heavey and kind of bother my ears. For reference I use a steelseries PC headset while gaming on PC, which I find more comfortable. Maybe they just need to be broken in a bit more. Overall pretty satisfied with my purchase. Mic quality is a huge upgrade from that standard earbud junk they package in the PS4 box.\n",

      "34783137: Worth Its Cost First of all, I am a gamer.  I own (and play on) an Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Xbox One, and (my favorite) Playstation 4.  My hearing is like my eyesight -- lousy.  So when I found out that the new improved TOMB RAIDER for the PS4 accepts voice commands, I looked around and chose this headset because it is made by Sony (like the PS4).  It's great.  And I also wear it when I watch Amazon Prime and Netflix movies/TV shows.  I am watching BOSCH on Amazon Prime right now and this headset is making it much more pleasant to view my entertainment choices.  I once owned a Turtle Beach set which I didn't really care much for.  This is a fair-priced good quality headset.\n",
      "50164443: Now I Can Play Whenever I Want and the Roommates Won't Want To Kill Me Excellent headphones. Some of the other reviewers mention the headset falling off but I've had no troubles. I have a small head and they fit snug right out of the box. One thing to note though is that they can be a bit uncomfortable if you wear glasses. I lift mine up and rest them right above the earpiece. I probably look goofy, but they are much more comfortable. The sound quality is excellent and the battery life is pretty good (I got roughly 7-8 hours out of them before they chirped and died). The biggest plus is that they are rechargeable straight from your system. Note you may have to change the settings on the PS4 to recognize your headphones as the primary audio.\n",

This is a lemon of a product.\n",
      "42026255: Excellent sounding headset with just few minor quibbles Nice headset sound is amazing.  I previously had the last generation Playstation wireless stereo headset (not the Elites) and sound is about the same as those.  Not a bad thing, sound on this headset is full and crisp with excellent bass tones. I especially like that it came with a 3.5 mm cable so I could connect to my mobile and other devices, that was a big selling point for me.  The only thing about these is they are undoubtedly heavier than the last generation headset so it makes my ears hurt faster from increased pressure.  Mic also isn't as clear based on friends opinions; obviously its harder to get clearer mic sound with a hidden mic than having a retractable mic as the last gen did that came close to your mouth. On the bright side these do look way cooler since the mic is hidden and the fact that you can connect it to ALL your devices makes this a better headset than the last gen wireless stereo headset.  Plus you can fold it for portability and comes with a nice carrying pouch.\n",

Never spent this much on headphones (even with the great deal), but I figured it was better than buying some crummy beats headphones. Got these to play games while my fiancee was asleep, but honestly I love to play games with them even when she's gone! I've never heard games like I have with these one! It's truly how games were meant to sound. Even sounds great when watching Netflix or listening to music. Works awesome on PS4, PS4, PC, and iPod (confirmed on all of them). Super comfortable too, I can wear them for several hours and not be bother at all. Seriously, I've had studio headphones (that cost me twice as much) that didn't sound as great or were as comfortable. Plus they look really cool. Buy these now, you won't be sorry\n",

While playing in PS3, even the slightest sounds are heard.2) Fairly good charge lasting length.3) Have option to use as wireless or wired headset.4) option to choose desired sound effect.Cons:1) weak noise isolation.  Those who sit near us can hear sound from the headset and we can hear them talking too.2) The customizable sound effects is more pronounced on ps3 than other sources.Will you recommend to a friend? Yes, I'll recommend this to a friend.\n",

      "16931439: Is the original Wireless Stereo Headset for the PS3 very different to the Gold Wireless for the PS4? First I want to say that as a previows owner of the Wireless Stereo Headset for the PS3, I bought the Gold Wireless Stereo Headset for the PS4 because at this date (24/07/2014) the PS4 doesn't support the PS3 headset for all the audio. So I'm comparing the PS4 official headset to the official PS3 headset.Pros:-The Gold headset sound is great, as good or even better than the PS3's headset.-The bass-amp option is amazing.-You can fold it and reduce the space when stored.-You can use the headset with a lot of devices (other than the PS3, PS4 and PC) due to the 3.5mm audio jack.Cons:-The headset makes a \\\\\"beep\\\\\" everytime I adjust the general volume and the chat/sound volume, and it's annoying because when it beeps all the sound is muffled during the beep. I can't adjust the sound fast because of that.So if you are an owner of the official PS3 headset, don't expect too much difference from this headset in terms of quality, the sound and mic quality is pretty much the same as the original PS3 headset. So just wait until Sony supports the PS3 headset in the PS4. If you have never owned an official Playstation headset this headset is amazing for its price ($80).\n",
      "49697685: If you use chat, don't buy these. Bought these replace my Sony Wireless Headset for PS3 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053OLY9O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)Sound quality is really great. Mic quality is really bad.So if you use chat during games do not buy these headphones. If you don't chat - these headphones are amazing.\n",

      "9888346: Great headphones I bought these when they went on sale and I didn't expect much from a pair of wireless headphones for under $100 but let me tell you they are amazing. they're comfortable I've worn them for about 5 hours straight with no issues. battery life is great not sure how long they last but I used them for a couple of days straight without needing recharge. The 7.1 is pretty damn good and the bass is actually really good and I think the most important part, the sound is so clear. I recommend these headphones for your PS4/PS3\n",
      "49262980: Horrible! Expected a bit more bass on these cans, but sounds a bit flat. That usb dongle thingy is also a put off. Why should you need a dongle to interface a product by the same manufacturer? Lame! just get a proper set of cans and hook them up to your controller.\n",
      "8600297: Comfortable fit and great sound These are some pretty great headphones, and here's why.1) great sound, the audio quality is clear and the surround sound feature is a nice touch.2) amazing fit, very comfortable. I can wear these for hours at a time and not be bothered the slightest bit.3) I like that these have the volume control on the headphones themselves, which was a big reason I bought them. I didn't like going to the menu three times and adjusting the volume to get it just right. With these you can still enjoy whatever you're doing and adjust the volume easily.4) finally, I just love that I can do whatever on my PS4 and not have to worry about waking my dad up at night. I typically use my PS4 at night and I can play games, watch Netflix, or do anything quietly, without having to sacrifice sound quality, or sacrifice hearing what is actually going on in whatever I'm doing.\n",
      "1250174: Great Great sound, got it with Prime so it came in 2 days and was nice packaged.The 4-foot long cable does not appear to actually be that long though.The ear pieces can make your ears sweaty if you're using it for an extended period but for a 2hr use it will be fine. The bass isn't superb but its great.It charges quickly, in about 40-45 mins from empty to full.The best thing about these is that with the 3.5mm jack they can work with my iPod\n",

I had high hopes for these headphones, but am disapointed after using them for several weeks with over 80 hours of gameplay. My biggest complaint is with the headset is the microphone. Many of the other players complain that they are unable to hear me as I sound like I am far away or muffled. The ear pieces are comfortable after long hours of gaming. The simulated surround sound works exceptionally well as you can distinguesh where the shots (Battlefield 4) is coming from.In the end these headphones are okay. The sound is good but the microphone is what kills the overall rating. I was able to get the microphone to work better by removing the removeable faveplates. The microphone is a tiny hole under the faceplate which I feel interferes in picking up sound. I shouldnt have to remove the faveplate for others to hear me.\n",

      "48929594: A worthy guaranteed to work headset for the platform I bought these to eliminate the guesswork from the platform.  The stay powered for hours, you can use the mic to stream to twitch and talk to people in game, and there's a companion app to help with settings which I don't quite understand because there are no games to speak of out yet to try it with.This should resolve itself soon.This does eat up a usb port with a dongle for some reason.  I mention it in case it's important to you, like if you wanted to use two fight sticks and the headphones.\n",
      "14086750: Shockingly Comfortable These headphones are the first ones I've used that are comfortable to wear. For those of us that wear glasses, it can be difficult to find headphones that don't grind the earpieces of our glasses into the side of our heads, but the padding and lack of pressure on these headphones do the job. Having the wireless headphones, controls on the earpiece, and comfort makes these the best headphones I've used. I'd recommend them to anyone.\n",

Nice no wires and last a decent amount of time maybe around 7 hours.  Sound quality is good, better than I thought it would be.  Hate that it folds up because that is a possible  place for it to break in future.  All in all it's a good headset\n",

      "2658022: Great value for a versatile gaming headset. Having purchased these on sale for 69.99 I feel I got a great deal but even at the list price of 100 dollars these are still a great buy.The most important factor for me when buying these was the sound quality, which I will say is pretty good considering the fairly light construction, price, and intended market. You can get better quality headphones for the same price but you can't get better wireless gaming headphones for less. Considering their versatility in that regard makes it easy to forgive the lack of bass and over all volume. That said, you'll never be able to wear these in public. They leak sound like a German car leaks oil. Unless you want everyone else to hear your music, keep these at home. This also means they lack any noise canceling factors, good for at home use, bad for anywhere that's not quiet.The range on these headphones when used wirelessly is also rather pitiful. I had hopes of plugging these to my ps4, turning on music unlimited and walking into the kitchen to cook with no wires catching the knobs on the cabinets. I have an open kitchen / living room layout as well with no obstructions and about 12 feet away seemed to be the max distance before I was listening to the sweet melody of static.In short : great gaming headset. Just make sure you turn off the vss and turn on the bass boost in the ps4 app\n",

Item came in just 3 days after being shipped and if you're considering buying this headseat I'd order from them. It cost me about $80 total and it was shipped to my house in 3 days. Over all it's a great headset although the buttons can be a tad pit confusing and i wish it had the feature that turtle beaches use where you can hear yourself talk. Sometimes I feel like I'm yelling into the mic because I can't hear myself talking over the game sound.\n",

      "23519373: The sound is GREAT high quality! It's not low at all!! These are awesome. It has options on the playstation headset app (ps4) to be tuned to specific games or to just genres in general. I'm playing The Last of Us remastered right now and the 7.1 surround sound sounds crystal clear like an actual theater system. It has the option for that game on the app. The hidden mic is surprisingly good too, you don't need to adjust the sensitivity on it. It automatically goes up and down weather you're speaking loud or just whispering it adjusts to your voice. As far the volume goes, I don't know why everyone is complaining it sounds pretty loud when there's action going on in the game. I'm having no problems with it whatsoever. You just have to choose right stuff on the app. The only thing that's annoying is that  its a little hard distinguishing weather you're turning up your friends voice up or your game sound but once you get it you don't have to mess with it again.\n",
      "21820507: Gold wireless headset is right! What a pleasant surprise!  This is a great headset for the ps4. The sound is excellent and the 7.1 surround sound works great. They have good padding around the ears so you can use them comfortably for hours. At $99 they are a great value and could easily be worth $130. I got them on sale from amazon for $69.99, what a steal! I would highly recommend this headset. Did I mention it has custom audio modes (ps4 app), hidden noise canceling mic, rechargeable battery, 7.1 surround,  and they fold up for easy travel. Buy them you won't regret it!\n",

      "3498944: Good wireless headset I was looking around to purchase a wireless headset but did not want to pay a arm and a leg for one. For about $80 (Amazon) compared to $100 (Retail) these were perfect for me. What I like about this headset is the wireless feature. I came from Turtlebeach P11's (due to cable itself wearing out) and I am highly satisfied overall. Besides everything else mentioned in the product description I did find a couple of things that people should be aware about and are as follow .(Please note this review only applies to my headset and may or may not reflect product overall)CONS:- Headset will fade in and out momentarily  (As if signal is lost. Headset is used directly in front of Ps3.)- When adjusting balance between sound/chat there is no clear indication where you are. (Only thing that notifies you that you are at min/max is a double beep.)- Headset sounds soft/low. When at max vol. it is not loud or not loud enough. Not saying it has to make my ears bleed but it could be louder.- When headset is in use all other audio is shut off. (Tv,Stereo system) Meaning if you have headset on no one else can hear you play.PROS:- Headset is nice and snug on my head (Can move and look around without fear of headset slipping or falling off)- Headset is very comfortable to wear and earpiece wraps around your ear comfortably. Have not had any discomfort from use.- WIRELESS- Good Battery life. Was able to get about 9 - 10 Hours. Headset was off when not in use.Overall I am very satisfied with these Sony Gold wireless headset. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good wireless headset or anyone looking for a wireless headset. Quality overall is very good and build as well. Everything you get from these is above and beyond and you pay less for more!\n",

      "25238715: Not as great as Pulse Elites This headset is great for the price and definitely more stylish than its predecessor, the Pulse Elites, but thats about all it has on them. The sound quality of the Golds is inferior to the Pulse Elites in every way. However, they definitely are more comfortable than any other headset I've tried. You tend to forget they're there after awhile, even if you wear glasses. This isn't a BAD headset by any means though. The sound quality is great for a $90 headset, but the slightly more expensive Pulse Elites are better.If you want a good headset for your PS3 or PS4 that will last awhile, these are a good option.If sound quality is your top priority, get the Pulse Elites.\n",
      "25319356: Huh?  Wha?! Think awesome, and then multiply that by 10.  That describes these headphones.  Comfy, great sound, easy to use, fits in with everything else and also seems to resolve conflicts with members of the opposite sex.  Absolutely love these things.\n",
      "2727187: Five Stars Excelent accesorie, the best sound 7.1\n",
      "3837520: Easily the best PS4 headset for the price. Considering the price, this headset is an absolute steal. The audio quality and the virtual surround sound - they really up a video games immersion! The headset is comfy, more comfortable than a Turtle Beach I own. The only drawback is the build quality; everything is great, but I feel like the headset should be handled very carefully.  Repeated rough handlings of this headset would likely result in a broken headset. Given the price, this is practically a must have for anyone who owns a PS4.\n",
      "34850097: Amazing Headset!!! Sound is crisp and clear! the headset itself is very light and easy to set up! I have enjoyed the sound greatly!!!! If you want, you can also use it with any other device and it projects sounds you have probably never heard!!!!\n",
      "26835805: Wear glasses at night?  Look elsewhere, my ears hurt after 20min! Everyone says it's great for the price, but for those that are willing on spending a bit more, do so!Before reading, for those of you who take off their contacts at night and wear glasses, look elsewhere!The sound quality is great on these things, and it's excellent with easability.  After connecting the wireless USB dongle and turning on the headset, it literally connects in seconds.But after a mere 15-20min of use my ears start to hurt while wearing  glasses.  I don't consider my ears larger than normal, but it's the headsets pressure I believe that's sandwiching my glasses to both my ears and skin.  This is extremely annoying while watching movies, and it is def. noticeable.I was willing on spending another $100.00, but the favorable reviews and ease of use got me hooked on purchasing.3 stars because it is a good headset (good bass, settings, integrated mic & app, no amp needed, no silly audio cables - bluetooth, the build quality is top notch (if only the padding was softer))-2 stars because my ears!  ouch!!\n",
      "5227304: HUGELY IMPRESSED, READ FOR DETAILS Ok, first off if you're scrolling through reviews getting a good idea of what most people are saying, STOP and go buy these. I cannot stress enough how much &#34;Bang for your Buck&#34; you're getting here with these. Granted, if you are an audio freak who is seeking acoustic perfections, why are you looking at an affordable Sony alternative? (Not that Sony makes poor qualtiy products). I'm sure there are headsets in the $300-$400 range that can slightly out perform an $85 pair, but slightly doesn't justify it enough for me to take that leap. I come from the Turtle Beach PX4's because I, as like most, were too impatient to wait for these to be released. The PX4's were good, but that's about it. Sound quality and surround was good, but to me they fit very abrasively. The padding was stiff and not overly welcoming to the ears and head. The Gold wireless headset definitely has it beat in all regards. Sound is crisp and clear, and can even be customized via an app on the PS4. For me, the biggest difference was the comfort. They went above and beyond in this aspect and gave a perfect combination of plush ear covers and squishy head padding. All while feeling tight and sturdy on your head.I am passionate about sound and acoustics myself (whether it be car audio, home systems, headphones or headsets) and don't let myself be swayed by just a name such as Turtle Beach, Astro, Bose, etc. I enjoy when a company releases a quality product at an affordable (or very affordable in this case) price. And Sony has gained a lot of respect from me with the PS4 and this headset. What you get out of these is just under the peak of the nicest headphones available.The only gripes I could see people using is a slight sound &#34;bleed&#34; at high volumes. Meaning If you are playing BF4 at full volume the people in the room with you will probably know. Also the battery life is a solid 8 hours. While this is good, Coming from the PX4's 15 hour battery life, it takes alittle getting used to. But as I stated above, any gripes or complaining are an insult to how good of a deal this headset is and quite frankly is just being spoiled or greedy. If you are looking for the worlds fanciest, outrageously priced headset, awesome more power to you. Just don't mark these down just because they don't have &#34;ASTRO&#34; slapped on the side. If your looking for anything under that, you'll be golden buying these ;)\n",
      "5579120: hi Headset is great, but the darn thing has a little tear in it now and I'm very angryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.  Probably due to my brother messing with it, but ya good product.\n",
      "3202017: Great all around headet I really love this headset. What I like best is the wireless capabilities as well as the included headphone jack so you can use it with mp3 players and other devices that do not have a usb port. So far I have no complaints as it pertains to sound quality and chat quality.\n",
      "45493119: The charging cord is just ridiculous The BIGGEST complaint I have about this headset is the charging cord. Although it does say it in the description now that I look back at it, I guess I just assumed that it would have been more than THREE inches. If you're headset dies in a game, then you'll either need to lean real close to a USB port or have an extension cord hanging from your ear... Not a very good design!The clarity and treble in the headset is actually optimal. However, the bass is lacking. If you're expecting pulse in your ears, this didn't deliver that for me. I would note that I have had no connectivity issues. It was a VERY easy setup. Just plug the blue tooth dongle in the Playstation and turn them on... Voila!The charging cord is just ridiculous...\n",

They don't mention that in any of the setup instructions.\n",
      "12970511: good product with some flaws It's a good product for this price but it could be better. Microphone voice is low quality(default mono headset's much more better). Also the sound level is insufficient, even in highest volume it's lower than it should be. But connecting, battery, ease to use, overall sound is nice. Light, too.\n",
      "25894447: Dynamic game specific sound schemes are a great touch on ps4 For the price this headset can't be beat. It works seamlessly with ps3, ps4 and with xbox1 if you have headset adapter. Dynamic game specific sound schemes are a great touch on ps4. Also, having a wireless mic is a great touch. They sound great and even fold up nicely to store in the bag they come with.\n",
      "8549990: Better Than Sex! *A review from a 20 year old virgin* In turns of comfort, this headset is like sex for my ears. If I ever lose my virginity and it is nothing like the comfort of this headset, I will be very disappointed. Especially when I just can't imagine sex being as awesome as the sound quality the headset provides. A truly excellent headset, I recommend it to everybody with a PS4.\n",

Bluetooth with a mic is a hard feature to find at this price but these aren't the most amazing sounding headphones I own. For gaming sure get them so you can chat but for music or fidelity get something else.\n",
      "6575923: Best Headset for the Price So I have had this Headset for about a month now. I love them and I use them for my PS3 and PS4. I have used them with my computer as well. Now I used to use a terrible little Bluetooth piece to play online with my friends. Now when i play with them they don't hear any of my background sounds.The surround sound is amazing on these, I tested it out by watching Tron Legacy and was turning it on and off (to turn on and off you have to hold it down till you hear a beep). The other thing that I did quite like is that it was super easy to set up. All I had to do was put the USB Adapter into the system then turn on the headset and boom all the sound transferred to the headset and the mic worked with out any problems. (Though the one thing I will say is that on the PS4 you need to go into settings and change the audio output because it does stay on the tv.) I also used them on my computer and was skyping with them and they worked just fine (but make sure to use the adapter for the mic to work). I have also used them with my music player and they certainly do what I want them too. However I have not tried them with my phone yet so I don't know how they do with phone calls or anything (my current crap phone isn't worth the test).Now I give these five stars because I did get them on an awesome sale of $70. I had been looking for a Headset for better quality online playing and chatting, and i wanted them to be wireless.  I couldn't find anything under $130 that was actually good. So these being what they are they are exactly what I wanted.Now I have taken into consideration what some people have said that is wrong with it. Some of you just got bad luck. Now I do agree with some, yes the charging cable is super short but you can just use an android phone charger to charge them. For the first couple times i used them i had them to far forward on my head and they started to hurt after a while but I quickly realized that and have them sit a little farther back and its all okay now. As far as volume goes you have the volume control on one side and sound/chat on the other, I have found that hitting volume up and down doesn't do much but if you hit the sound/chat button while playing with friends that one way makes that chat go down and game sound go up and vice versa.\n",
      "13754187: Feels great, sound does bleed a bit and one side ... Feels great, sound does bleed a bit and one side does sound louder than the other. The settings and options are a plus. Got used so might have something to do with difference in sound on each side\n",
      "50622422: Worth Every Penny For the money these are great headphones for gaming.  One thing I wasn't expecting is that when a game isn't playing the microphone picks up the noise of the room and plays it in the headphones very clearly.  It works so well that at first I thought the cups were just really really crappy at blocking sound.  But I really like how I don't have to take them off or move a cup off to hear when my family is talking to me.  The sound quality as not as good as my non-microphone headphones but considering those were 3x times as expensive I'm fine with that.  My only negative is that I find the buttons on the sides hard to work unseen but I'll get used to them with practice.  I would totally buy them again.\n",

I have a TV that I can't turn up loud due to neighbors, and this doesn't burn my ears off, or get glitchy in my distance from the TV.I used to have the Turtle Beach headphones and I enjoyed them, and these are pretty much on par. If you have an Xbox one, I also recommend these headphones, but don't forget, you need to buy the Xbox One Stereo Headset adapter and wire it to the controller.The mic is a tad muffled, but my my inability to remember to turn them off when I am finished with them, making the battery die is the biggest issue. .Great product!\n",

      "42415634: great headset but has some issues Its a great wirless headset but it has a couple issues. First issue i get better sound quality on pc than i do on ps4, it took me a while to figgure out how to get them working on ps4. On pc its pretty much plug and play. Issue 2 the pc support is a little spoty. Ive tried the headset on over 30 games no issues except for on DMC, and Dishonered the sound is messed up after the amd logo the sound like fades out like it doesnt want to work, but good news is it goes a way after a few minutes in game.(i personally think that boils down to nvidia vs amd). The mic chat seems to work well on pc,  as well ps4. The ps4 requires an app download, but after i set the profile i still didnt feel like the ps4 gave off great sound i didnt see the 7.1 option nor have i experienced the promised 7.1 surround sound on ps4. I use virtual surround  sound on pc in the sound options on the headset panel options. There is no choice on ps4 to pick to pick the 7.1 it must be automatic i noticed a vss button on the side but it didnt seem to make it louder on ps4. the sound profiles on ps4 can b set by game like say killzone, watchdogs, knack, so on. idk what your sound quality would be if u use a killzone profile for knack or a mix match. The plastic peace on the side fell off but it was put back on very easily. Other reviews noted the cheapness of the plastic, but the overall build is solid. Also for those wondering if any additional cords are need ed on pc nope everthing goes thru the usb. I really like the headset and totally recommend it its just has some minor issues, no deal breaker issues. This is a solid headset for the price and it works on PlayStation family, and pc. So if your in the market for a ps4/pc combo headset this is for you. It'll even work on your mobile music player or phone. Totally worth it. I Recommend it , i just had a couple issues to make it a 3 star product instead of a 4 or 5\n",
      "49589334: They sound so good that they'll make your ears sweat! These are a very nice headset for gaming and music. The built in mic is great so you don't look like a ding-dong with a mic sticking out.  They sound very good and bass-y when playing games and the 7.1 is really nice when you hear things from all directions.  They also sound very good when listening to music.They also double as ear muffs/warmers.  They are &#34;closed&#34; headsets meaning you get zero air flow and because of the vinyl material, my ears get very hot while wearing them.  This is pretty much a deal killer for me, personally.  Also, I get confused which side is L and R because the L and R are very faintly marked inside of the headphones.\n",
      "44909032: Fantastic buy. Bought at a competitor, but very much enjoy this headset.

The sound is incredibly clear and has a very dynamic range.  Love these!\n",
      "14803027: Skeptical before I purchased I am an Amazon but I bought from Best Buy because they had a weekend sale. Normally, at $99, it is a great buy. Best Buy had it for $70 for the weekend. After thorough use, including my mac and pc, I found the one flaw with the gold headset. IT SUCKS WHEN TRAVELING BETWEEN ROOMS IN MY TINY APARTMENT! Either way, sound quality is great (I am a certified audio engineer), buttons are well placed, and it's perfect for gaming with the PS4. If you can handle small disruptions when traveling around your home, this is a great headset. Do not sleep on the gold if you are on a budget. Best headset you will find at this time,for the money, guaranteed!\n",

When playing CoD I can hear so much more then I did before and sounds on any game is crisp, clear, and at times will make me think someone is in the house when I am alone.

Supposedly the headset might've been affected after the last PS4 update.Wasn't able to hear him via chat, but game sound came in fine. Workaround was to turn volume up all the way on the headset (hold vol up until you hear double beep), then click the volume down button five times. Could hear him and the game fine after that. Not sure why this works, though the fix came from a forum out there which I'm not able to remember right now.\n",

Battery life seems to be reasonable, just wish the supplied USB charging cable was longer to enable use while charging.Use for gaming is fantastic as there is a lot more distinction between sounds when compared to my TV. Comforting around the ears, which definitely makes it far more enjoyable to use, especially when compared with the PS4 chat earpiece.\n",

      "18691139: they work perfectly for playing my PS4 with good, loud audio in the early mornings and weekends I'm not in the market for high end headphones as I bought these primarily to not disturb my girlfriend and dog while they're sleeping. As such, they work perfectly for playing my PS4 with good, loud audio in the early mornings and weekends. Easy to set up, comfortable, and compact to store. Sound is crisp and clear. Good purchase for the price.Haven't tried chat yet, but I'll edit my review once I dive into the Destiny beta this weekend.EDIT: Finally used chat during the Destiny beta and it worked incredibly well. The PS logo goes facing the back of your head not the front, and chat worked great all weekened.I did find the sound somewhat lacking when watching movies on Netflix, however. It sounds good, just not very loud, even when chat is turned off. Not too bad as I will be using this 99% of the time for gaming which works great.\n",

      "20153772: A pricey set of listening devices. These as just headphones are fantastic, but you aren't going to get them for just the sound. The mic is hidden and thus not in front of your mouth which makes you distant. I returned these since I was looking for a headset that I can use to talk to my friends as we play. For a wireless set these are a steal, but you you should consider looking for another if you want to be heard.On the plus side, they are comfortable and works well on PC.\n",

      "42684538: Awesome Headset. Easy set-up and great sound quality. I have comfortably worn them for extended periods of time without any discomfort. Being able to increase chat volume and lower in-game sound volume is a great feature! Haven't had a chance to use the mic yet for online gaming, will update once I do. Hopefully it's better than the old PS3 wireless Bluetooth headset\n",
      "12970469: Overall a good headset This headset is great for the price but it's always good if you can buy this cheaper. At the time of my purchase I got this for the price of 79.99, but sadly the following week after my purchase there was another price drop to 69.99. Oh well I'm still glad I got this headset.The following list are my opinions.PROS:1. It's by far a better alternative than using the earphones that come with the PS4.2.It's cosmetically a pretty headset.3. Great audio but not as great as a high dollar headset.4. VERY simple to activate to the console and switch between another. Just simply plug the dongle into the desired console.CONS:1. The quality of the microphone is not that great. Everytime I use it my friends tell me my other headset sounds way better (the original ps3 Bluetooth headset).2. Buttons are in odd places. It just doesn't feel natural.OVERALL: it's a good headset for the price so it's worth a buy.\n",
      "1444616: Five Stars Great headset for the price and can be used with all of the gadgets/electronics I use.\n",
      "9496350: Pretty decent headset. *UPDATE*  Great news! This headset is about as sturdy as a toothpick. Went to put them on a few weeks ago and SNAP! Right side of the headset snaped. No problem. Tape will fix that. Even better news. The same thing happened yesterday but this time with the right side. FANTASTIC. All of this and I'm also on my 3rd DS4 controller since the other 2 decided they didn't want to function anymore. Sony is putting out quality stuff, I tell ya.    First and foremost, I got these when they were on sale for $70. Luckily for me. For reference, I've had just a bit of experience with other &#34;Budget headsets&#34;, they are the Turtle beach X11's, X12's and the Sennheiser x320 (Which were apparently $150 when they were first released, but have since dropped to about $50, which is the price I go them for.)  Alright, now that that is out of the way, on to my review. This headset is pretty decent. To put it simply. Let me point out the positives first: More comfortable than either Turtle Beach's I had previously owned, and they're on par with the Sennheiser in this category. I know some reviewers have pointed out that they have a big head, but let me assure you, I have a humongous head. It probably accounts for half of my body weight (I'm not even kidding) and these fit very snug. The padding around the headsets themselves FEEL like higher quality compared to the headsets I've previously used, but then again, these are more expensive so I was expecting that. The sound is pretty good. I honestly can't say for sure if they're better than any of the headsets I owned before. I just cant tell the difference, probably due to the fact that I haven't used them in a long time. The build quality is nice. Some people have complained about how these feel like they were made with cheap plastic, but I have to disagree. If these were built using plastic, it is not cheap plastic. At least, not to me. They feel nice. I don't know what other way to put it. I can't say much about the charge time because I always have these charging when I'm not using them, and I haven't let them die on me.  Now for the negatives: First and by far the most annoying thing in my honest opinion, is the fact that these take up a USB slot on the PS4 if you want to use the ridiculously short charger cable these came with. For whatever reason, if you didn't already know, the PS4 only has TWO USB slots. Yep, two. So having these take up one of those at any time is....just no bueno. At all. I can go on all day about this, but this is mostly a build design issue with the PS4 itself. Moving on, these make my ears sweat, Though, to be fair, the only headset I've used that didn't do this were the Sennheiser X320. Probably also has something to do with the fact that its summer time and my room is the hottest room in the house, but it's annoying, nonetheless.  All things considered, for the price, I would buy these. Not sure if I would shell out the full $100 for them though...  Since this is already long enough, I'm going to leave it at that. I hope my review helps. :)\n",

My voice was so deep and garbled that no-one could understand what I was saying.  I thought it might have been due to needing a charge, but nope, fully charged and still crap.  The sound isn't horrible and like others have said the lows are non existent, but stay away from this head phone if you want to save yourself the headache of dealing with sending them back and researching your next pair.\n",

Not a lot of settings and when the platinum version comes out I'm sure they will be $50 more with more settings.Sound: 4 out of 5 could use more base, without the vss in its kinda flat sounding, not a lot of settings.Comfort: 5 out of 5really light and comfortable.

      "11387384: For the price, WOW!!! This headset has been one of the best headsets I have invested in for the price. The designs looks like it wouldn't be comfortable, but they are some of the most comfortable headsets that I have worn, right up there with my Turtle Beach PX5s, and they adjust very easily with slide able ear cups. They form a nice seal around the ear to block out surrounding noise. The material is very sturdy and doesn't feel cheap in any way. I played a nice 15 hour day on a single charge and recharging the headset took about 45 minutes for a full charge. The charge cord is really short compared to other cords, but with an extender cord it is no problem. Syncing the item to the ps3 and ps4 was simple. Simply plug in the usb stick and the headset was instantly recognized. The sound quality is very good for the price. If you are strictly looking for a headset for sound alone, then these are not for you as the sound is definitely not a turtle beach or boss quality, but for the price very well done. The PS4 app allows you to customize option 2's settings or to sync the settings that developers of a specific game has given to Sony on how they intended for you to hear the game. Option 1 is a set setting that cannot be changed, but set up for almost every game mode. The sound comes across crisp and I had no problem telling where other players or AI were on the map. Playing with the volume, virtual surround sound, mute and chat volume took some getting used to, but once you learn the position of each it becomes second nature and very easy to operate. Plus they are all located on the left ear cup. I would recommend these headsets over any of the lower end turtle beach headsets and definitely over the other Sony headsets on the market. Can't beat the quality of this headset for the price range!!!\n",

      "11630004: The perfect headset for its pricing This headset is perfect for my needs. The lack of wires means I can transition from my Playstation 3 to my PC seamlessly. It is very comfortable so I can wear it for extended periods of time. The wireless range is also pretty good: I've walked about 30 or so feet away before the sound started to break up. The sound quality itself is outstanding. I was playing Dead Space 3 and the ambiance was frightening. As for the mic, at first the mic sounded fuzzy and muted, but as I used it more the mic adjusted itself to sound clearer and now works well. So far I have not experienced any issue with battery life. Speaking of which, the cord they give you is rather short, but the charging port is a standard micro USB port, so any micro USB charger, like one you would use for your phone, would be just fine to charge this with. The headset itself has good weight on it, but not too heavy, so it doesn't feel cheap at all like other reviewers have stated.\n",
      "44216111: A Great Product. Iv'e had my PS4 Gold Headset for about a week now so now that iv'e obv. had some time with it I can give a proper review. The setup was pretty much non existent you literally just charge the headset than plug the little receiver into one of the USB ports and turn on the headset and your good to go, I found them comfortable I don't do &#34;marathon gaming&#34; so i wouldn't know how they are for 10+ hours straight on your head but for the 2-3 hours at a time I play they are very comfortable I have no issue with them. The sound quality is excellent, all the explosions and gunshots sound loud and clear and the chat quality is excellent as well. You can also download the Headset Companion app on your PS4 straight from the Playstation store and in there they give you pre-made sound settings like for fps games, racing etc. even movies and music settings, or you can just go ahead and create your own setting. So the headset does have some customization which obv is a plus. The Chat/Game balance buttons are on the ear piece along with the mute button and the button to turn on/off the 7.1 surround sound (you have to be using it wireless in order to get the 7.1, if your plugged into the controller you will not get 7.1 but its still good stereo surround sound) Iv'e also used this headset gaming on my laptop and it worked flawlessly. Over all I gave the headset the 5 Stars because I honestly feel it deserves it, if your in the market for a new PS4 headset I HIGHLY RECOMMEND picking these up. For the price they are its a steal.\n",

      "14465286: I like these. They are light I like these. They are light, very comfortable, charge quickly, and last for at least 7-8 hours. My biggest complaint is the volume.

Maybe I'm just used to my noise cancelling Bose, but the low end part of the sound spectrum lacks a little with these.\n",

They're comfortable, sound great, and are super easy to set up. Better yet, they can be used with not only Sony consoles but with the Xbox One as well, if you have the chat adapter. Across the board, they work great and sound excellent, and while at times I think they confuse volume for quality, more often than not everything sounds clear and just like it should. Already I'm picking up on sounds I didn't even know there in certain games. At $100 they're a steal, and I've consistently seen them for at least $10 off retail on Amazon (I got mine for $70!), and at those prices they're an instant recommendation.\n",

My background is on xbox where there is only one expensive option for a completely wireless set up.  When the current gen came out I took a gamble and went with the PS4,  This of course gave me the opportunity to try out Sony’s far less expensive wireless surround sound sets.  On its face it seemed great.  Wireless, decent perceived frequency range, surround sound, ect.  The problem is I was playing on BF4 which is not really a twitch shooter and there is little to sound whore.  With that said, something felt like it was missing so I threw in CoD Ghosts.  First let me say, Ghosts sucks on the PS4.  I get frequent frame drops on my machine (I only play it on the xb360) to the point where it’s unplayable at times.  I immediately noticed the directionality was only a fraction of that of the Mixamp or the DSS.  Even with dropped frames I could at lease turn on someone and be facing the right direction before getting shot.  Not so with the Gold Edition.  It feels like it’s 3 or at best 4/10s of the Mixamp or DSS.  And even with larger directionality cues there was a distinct lag when you turned none of which is present with the Mixamp or the DSS.  With this all said, the soundstange and range was on par with the x12s.  If we could somehow get the dolby processor from the DSS into the Gold Edition we’d have something.  But as it is these are a step down from the Mixamp and DSS which is really unfortunate.\n",
      "25922502: Can't beat Sony hardware Great headset, the sync process with the PS3 is easy, just plug the dongle and turn on the power. With the PC, some driver download is required, but after that it is the same process as the PS3. I want to confirm that this IS NOT a bluetooth headset, so phones and PS Vita will need the cable, luckily, the headset can be off while wired, so it wont run out of power on the go.\n",
      "23561803: Okay sound but not the best Okay sound when you want privacy during game play but would be much better if they were noise cancelling.\n",
      "50412839: Line of sight only, this thing hates walls Everything about this is great just know that you want to be line of sight with the usb thing you plug into your ps4.  Does not work with XBox One.  I use it for PC, PS3 and PS4.\n",
      "14087009: Good, but if I plug the USB to my ... Good, but if I plug the USB to my PS4 or laptop before I turn those devises on, it messes them up.  Thought they died on me several times before I noticed this.\n",
      "3502011: Five Stars The headset is worth every penny.\n",
      "41163660: Great headset for low cost I bought a pair of these on sale for 79.99 and I will never look back. I have a pair of Turtle Beach DXL1's wired and these blow them out of the water for the same exact cost. The 7.1 virtual surround sound is absolutely amazing, I will give a warning standing near an explosion with these on full blast will make your ears ring due to how loud they are. I have not tried 200 or 300 dollar headsets are as they are outside my price range but I have tried everything in the 50 to 150 dollar range and these are my absolute favorite, they may not have the bass as some others but the audio quality is crystal and not muffled nor does it sound like garbage; I will also add if the audio is garbage it will sound like garbage no matter what headphones you have, I have had nothing but luck with these sounding great coming from a high quality audio source. Being wireless makes them an absolute must for gaming especially with the noise cancelling microphone and they sound pretty great hooked up via 3.5 mm jack to my laptop. I will highly recommend these for any avid gamer looking for a great headset within a 100 dollar budget. I will also add that you can plug in the usb receiver to a mac and use the headset wirelessly.\n",
      "3115109: Five Stars this item is pure quality , works with a lot of devices...\n",
      "1289443: Great Sound Quality Great piece of head gear. Great sound. I switched from my 200$ pair of Turtle Beach PX5's and the PS Headset has much better sound clarity. You will forget that these are on your head, which is great. They are very light and compact. I assumed they would be a little clunky but they aren't, they are sleek as hell. The only complaint i have is that i wish there was a metal reinforcement bar inside the padding to help with probable future accidents. Other than that they meet my needs perfectly.My only regret is i wished i bought these at PS4 launch day cause you haven't heard your favorite game till you've heard it with these. I'm replaying a few titles just for the Virtual Surround Sound on the Gold Wireless headset.\n",

      "41804563: Great headset Love this headset! Very comfortable and works great! However it does get a little uncomfortable after a couple hours.\n",
      "12927219: Sony hit a home run Great sounding headphone for less than $100. Super easy setup and charging directly from the USB outlet on the PS3 is a bonus.  Thought the customization from the Companion App would be a gimmick, but it actually works and creates two totally different listening experiences.  Hope more games take advantage of the advance sound options.  Hard to say this is truly 7.1 sound, but it sounds great with games and HD Movies.Fits large heads with no problems.\n",
      "37501111: Awful Mic!! I don't understand all the great reviews these get! I rated these low for a few reason. They were horrible get the sound just right. You can't adjust chat and game sounds on the unit. You can make one a bit louder but that is it. The app for to use on the ps4 is a joke. The biggest problem is your mic picks up EVERYTHING around you! People talking in the next room, your controller clicks, a fan, mouse farts, etc. Even adjusted to the lowest mic level it still does it.\n",

Very pleased with it! Great sound quality for the price. Battery life is good. Almost 8 hours of real life play time. Very comfortable. Set up is super easy. Love it with my PS3.\n",
      "34669054: Overall an awesome device and great value This is my first set of 3D headphones - effortless to set up and good battery life. Sound quality is great, but maybe not as amazing as a pair you'll pay $300 for, but overall an amazing value for the price - you'll hear things in Dark Souls you never knew were there.\n",

      "17673534: So close to perfection! Punchy, deep bass when set to second audio mode (&#34;2&#34;). Feels good, pretty light on the head, doesn't pinch the head down.  But, the biggest complaint is that the USB dongle no longer accepts audio cables!!  You can't use it as a wireless headset for any device - it really is limited.  The old Pulse headsets used to allow any device to become wireless by simply plugging in an audio cable to the dongle, so there was no need to plug in an audio cable to the headset.  However, the Gold headset now requires you to directly plug a cable from the device into the headphone itself.  What a bummer.\n",
      "50997556: Gold Wireless Stereo Headset They're awesome, love the bass feature on them.  I highly recommend them to anyone. They are well made and very comfortable to wear! :)\n",
      "32872995: Comfortable fit and works well with all his gaming systems My husband absolutely loves these!  Comfortable fit and works well with all his gaming systems.  Would definitely recommend!\n",
      "49349167: Comfortable, High Quality, and How the Experience was Intended This headset feels solid, properly weighted, and comfortable. The band and ears have fantastic padding, and the inner cups on the ears slant in a way that allows the ear to rest inside the headphones without bending or pushing against any part of the headset uncomfortably. Nearly everything is positive on the comfort side of things. The only minor critique would be that the headphones do make your ears feel a bit warm after using them for a long duration. I read someone else leave this in a review and I thought it was a bit overly critical, then I used the headset regularly for a while and realized what they were saying.The battery life is great for wireless use, and there is the 3.5mm headphone jack ability when needed. I also have had a great experience with the hidden microphone. Good enough, in fact, to use this headset for work when my normal headset is not available.The one drawback is the Headset Companion App on the PS4. I'm not changing the rating down because the app is a companion piece and not necessary for the product to be great (which it is.) However, if you do find yourself using the companion app, you will likely run into the same frustrations as me. It's slow, a bit clunky, and just not the best experience. It looks like Sony could improve it, though, and I love the idea of custom sound profiles depending on what I'm doing.I've become so accustomed to this headset that I use it as my primary headphones, backup work headset, and generally favourite Sony accessory.\n",

      "36392012: Only good if u have a tiny head It ended up falling apart at the parts that flex because of the tiny weak plastic blockers that keep it from over flexing and I have an average sized head I guess the tested it on a japanese standard head and once it breaks there there's no fixing it and believe me I've tried everything so I have a functioning headset that I have to wear with a headband over it because I refuse to buy another one because this one still works but flexing parts are defected so I only recommend if u have a less than average sized head\n",
      "51844132: Not too comfortable The design is not bad. I like how it folds which is a space saver. Sound quality is great. But not really comfortable after a few hours of use. It hurts my ears.\n",
      "12378780: Great Headset.. too bad sony's a monopoly :( Ive owned every Sony PS headset ever made, the first gens were the best design. the PS Pulse were terrible, product design was horrible, just by just pulling the earmuffs over you're head, you were inevitably breaking the headband, we couldn't believe they were even made, they were so bad.But these are a undated pair of the first gens, with the same features of the PS Pulse headset....SUM UP! they are Great! the feel and the design is on point, my father uses them for Bluray's on the PS4 he wouldn't have it any other way. they are legit. also you have a actual knob button for the power, and the options for 1 & 2,... 1 is standard, 2 is bass, and you can also download a app from the PSN store for these headsets, and customize you're own 2.\n",
      "9851628: Best Wireless Headset available for the PS4 and other platforms! This Headset which I Brought was a little while ago, and now I can now say with full satisfaction that I did not regret buying it one bit.  Its an overall great Headset with prefect comfort over ears, full audio and surround sound, dynamic settings, only supported with the PS4 app.  However, I did manage to find some dis-advantages, but they are minor and don't effect the headset too much.  Below is a full summary: -AdvantagesClear, powerful soundConvincing virtual surroundComfy, lightweight designAffordableAesthetically pleasing, easy touch features on the side of headsetCan be used on PC, PS VIta, Bluetooth connected device as wellHas a additional Wire that can be connected to phones and audio in devicesDis-AdvantagesLacks deep detailDialog can sound nasalOverall it's a fantastic headset for the next generation and mostly for those who have consoles and don't have a headset.  Definitely recommended, I would also certainly say that besides games console, this headset can be used for phones, PC, PS Vita and devices that can connect to the device via Bluetooth.  An additional wire is given to you in the packaging and that wire can be used to connect to a laptop, phone etc so its a definite buy for all.\n",
      "34108429: Gold Wireless Stereo Headset is Awesome! Great Gold Wireless Stereo Headset! Were cost effective, shipped quickly, and work great. Would definitely recommend them.\n",
      "37440857: Five Stars MY BROTHER USED ALL THE TIME\n",
      "51235945: Good headset for the money. The sound is good enough. It seems relatively sturdy. I have a larger head, but the band has enough flex that it doesn't squeeze too tight.Unfortunately, the ear cups are too small and not quite deep enough. After wearing for a bit, they get uncomfortable. Also my ears get a bit sweaty wearing these. The fake leather material probably doesn't breathe too well. Microfiber would have been better.I've only tried these with Tomb Raider so far, but I didn't notice much surround. I could easily tell whether enemies were to the left or right, but not front or back.\n",
      "20341962: Gold Wireless Headset is Golden Just bought my second pair but that's only because I lost my first. This alone should tell you the quality is great if I'm willing to shell out $100 for them again. While this may sound like a lot of money trust me when I say you won't find a headset of this quality for a lower price. 7.1 surround sound quality and PS4 games sound amazing. I've also noticed a major improvement speaker quality when chatting with friends over PSN. I highly recommend this headset not just for use in conjunction with a PS3/4 but also for home use with your PC.\n",
      "30546975: Awesome virtual surround If you have a Playstation and dont have these you need to get off the fence and buy them now!\n",
      "20525184: Average at best All these people with all these high ratings....  I guess middle America doesn't understand sound lol. For this price the Logitech g930 are a 100 times better. These aren't bad, don't get me wrong. But the sound.... Let's say I only use it for the chat channel, actual gaming Audio sounds like a 1999 Panasonic TV 2 watt built in speaker pair lolOhhhh and this super crap 'VESA' b.s. That Sony have is utter garbage too\n",
      "44901647: Surpassed all of my expectations Wow. I'm surprised that Sony didn't charge more for these!.For the price, these cannot be beat!  Whether it's for music or for gaming, this headset is awesome! Encapsulating sound with crisp highs, firm mids, and deep lows. They are comfortable on my average sized head and the cushions get softer the more you use them. The top band doesn't leave a dent in my hair after wearing them for extended periods of time. The cable for connecting to a phone/laptop/whatever is a 3.5mm aux cable and can be used in cars that have an aux input.\n",
      "13370078: Gold Wireless Stereo Headset. These headsets are absolutely amazing. It can be used on you ps3 and ps4. It can also be used on your laptops and phones. The noise cancelling works great and so does the microphone. I have no cons for this product.\n",
      "4068813: Nice headset My ferst headset.Nice headset for gaming on PS4 (Battlefield 4, Assasins creed 4, GTA 5, LoUS, Fifa)Great virtual surround/ Sound quality, comfort and competitive pricing converge with Sony's official PS4 headset/\n",
      "19107205: Great quality, but the comfort just isn't there for me. All three stars are for the overall quality of sound. The last two stars in my opinion are the comfort factors. My previous headset was a wired AfterGlow set. For $70 that set has amazing quality sound, but it wasn't comfortable for my head and it would begin to hurt after about an hour.The Golds rest right behind above my the back of my jaw and any fidgeting to relieve this just adds pressure to the top of my head. I've tried for several days to find a comfortable position to wear these but I haven't had any luck. I've had them for a few days now and at this point I'm hoping I can break them in. If it doesn't work out I know that over the ear headsets just don't work well for me. On the bright side, I can tolerate wearing these for several hours as opposed to just one.\n",
      "44961483: Terrific value! I purchased my pair shortly after thay came out and I can safely say after a ton of use they have been well worth the 99 I paid for them. My living room has 3 tvs in it so they defff come in handy when the roommates are watching or playing other things. Great buy!!\n",

      "39952010: Five Stars Excellent\n",
      "36206067: Great product! All the needed features like chat audio balance and intuitive controls, coupled with great sound. An awesome product that compares well to more expensive headphones that don't sound much better. It even works with my laptop. Battery life may be a bit short for hardcore gamers (about 2 hours without bass boost), but you can plug them in on the fly using a standard USB mini charger. I found the bass boost unnecessary as it has good bass response without it. I'm very happy with these headphones.\n",
      "20722228: Amazing This headphone is wonderful, great sound and very comfortable. An indispensable device for those who play for several hours.I don't regret buying it\n",
      "46559119: Painful for me to wear for long gaming sessions I would recommend a friend try any other wireless headphones but these.Cons:PAINFUL TO WEAR FOR LONG GAMING SESSIONS (3+ hrs approximate). NOTE: I wear glasses that have long arms that stick out behind my ears, which may exacerbate the problem. However, I've got a pair of Sony wired headphones that are perfectly comfortable. We probably have differently shaped ears so your milage may vary. For me though, that's a dealbreaker.More Cons:Battery life is too short. It's unacceptable to not last a whole day without needing a charge.Charging cord is really short (like 8 inches). It is impossible to use the headset while it is charging.Makes obnoxious, loud beeping noise when turned on. Because of this noise, I turn the headset on before putting it on now.Neutral:Unclear what virtual surround sound does. I couldn't distinguish an obvious difference between VSS off or on.Pros:Very immersive, but this could probably be said of any wireless headset.Sound quality is good and the bass is acceptable. I have no complaints. Of course, they can't even compare to good speakers with a sub.Design. This is tentatively a pro, contingent on it not breaking, because the headset seems sturdy.Mic. Exists and works. Easily mutable.\n",
      "38019629: Good plastic quality and design but sound Design is very good for this price. Faced some issues with connecting to PC. After connecting and switch on\\off receiver looses headphones and not going to find it until you connect it with the USB cord. There is not enough bass.\n",
      "2071440: Nice, very nice! Hello from Russia! Was delivered in 4 days!!!  It's amazing!  But the cost of delivery is high. And now I can't get,  why? My friend want them too but you can't deliver them to Russia. And what about headphones they are really amazing. Long distance from TV and ps4 are also tested and it's good.  Sound quality is super. The best for such low price.\n",
      "1602354: A steal! Dear fellow gamers,I just purchased a PS4 and wanted to buy a headset for it which didn't blow a hole in my pocket. After some research, I realized the Gold wireless stereo headset was perfect for me.And trust me, don't be fooled by the minimal price tag.The sound quality is flawless, and, paired with surround sound, gives you the best experience ever, either for shooters where you need to hear the faintest sound as well as for games in general.So far, I have played ACIV, Call of Duty: Ghosts and Battlefield 4. In these 2 months, no complaints whatsoever.\n",
      "41141605: Very good deal for under $100, a nice alternative for chat on the PS4. I was pleasantly surprised with this headset. It's got a ton of cool features, and very nice sound quality. It works simply by plugging the USB dongle (which is unnecessarily large) into the PS4, and then turning the headset on. Mode 1 is standard audio, while Mode 2 can be programmed to any mode you want (default is Bass Boost).The cool thing about Mode 2 is that developers release sound profiles for their games, so you can load a &#34;Watch_Dogs&#34; sound setting into your headset to be used with Mode 2. What's a bit strange is that the headset has to be plugged in to do this, so you need to get into the rhythm of changing the sound modes when you change game discs.It's got a built in mic, a mute feature, volume control, virtual surround sound, chat volume/game volume toggle buttons on the headset - the settings you're using display on your TV screen, and the light on the headset changes from blue to purple for mute. I haven't spoken with too many people on the PS4, but in the Destiny alpha I found the sound quality to be very good. I was looking for a one ear headset/mic for chat purposes (the included headset in the PS4 is rubbish), but I'm going to stick with this.The Good:-Wireless connection to PS4-Download audio settings for each game with companion app-Good sound and microphone quality-A lot of settings you can toggle on the headset itself-Includes an AUX cable for use as a regular headsetThe Bad:-PS4 connection requires a USB dongle, which is huge. I can see this getting damaged out in front of the PS4.-Have to connect to the PS4 to change audio settings for Mode 2.-Included charger cable is extremely short. I think you can use the DS4 charger on it, though.Overall, it's hard to beat for the price. If you want a headset for the PS4, this one is made for it and it shows.\n",

      "38083476: Works perfect will all my devices I linked it to the PS4 with ease and it also works nicely with the Vita.The headset fits nicely and there is little to no discomfort.My only complaint is that the power cord it comes with (USB) is too short to charge it while wearing it. Not really a problem since they use the same one as most android phones (Micro USB) and I had a spare.It comes with a well made cloth case to carry the headset and cord in.The sound quality of the headset is great!Other people I was talking to through the mic said I was loud and clear and a big difference from talking through my Playstation Camera.\n",
      "16166594: Works Wonderfully I'm not an audiophile by any means but I do like good sound. They work great, have had zero complaints so far from people hearing me and both chat only and full audio mode from the PS4 sound awesome. The companion app let's you tweak sound settings and even has some profiles for certain games. Solid purchase for the price ($80 at time of purchase)\n",
      "38360766: Good Headset Its a great product for an exceptional price.Did exactly what i purchased it for, listen wirelessly the game I'm playing on PS3. Its light, comfortable, and lasts for hours of fun.\n",
      "5236873: Average at Best I have the original PS3 headset so I thought I'd get another for the office but since the discontinued them this was the other choice. The headset is quite large so even adjusted as small as possible my ears do fit inside the cups causing the bow of my glasses to press gainst my head. This does not take long to get uncomfortable. In addition the bass is very loose. If you turn on the bass boost it really sounds terrrible.\n",
      "42621695: Good headset Doesn't do anything great, but it does everything good. Can't go wrong for the price and you won't be disappointed\n",
      "25063729: Bargain Can't beat the overall package for the price. I returned a $300 pair of headphones because I was satisfied with these.  Very comfy for longer sessions.\n",
      "1564784: Amazing headset This headset is amazing I'm an avid gamer I picked these up and was blown away. I play a lot of cod ghost and I am literally turning on people that are behind me all the time. Now personally if I'm gaming I will turn the vss off so I can actually tell we're they are. But I norm game anywhere from 4-6 hrs straight. There very comfortable, very easy to setup up can't ask for more for a great pair of headsets under a hundred bucks!  I highly recommend these for ppl that what to hear we're all the action is at.\n",
      "22474036: Some mic problems To start with, I'm coming from a still working PX5, but wanted a truly wireless solution because the chat cable was terribly annoying to me (I'm really not sure how anyone can deal with those wires while gaming).  Since there weren't too many options, and I wasn't really feeling like buying a $200+ headset like the a50, I figured these would work nicely.I started out by testing them out on my ps3 and ps4, since I often switch between the two.  Thankfully this was as simple as swapping the USB dongle between the systems and turning the headset on.  If I wanted to do that with my PX5 or even the a50's, that would mean having to swap the USB connection in the front and the optical connection in the back (not easy to do in my setup).  I installed the companion app on both of the systems and played around with the custom EQ a bit.Once things were running though, the first things my friends said when I got into the chat on the ps3 was how awful my mic sounded.  This was odd because it did seem to sound okay in the audio settings page where it echoes your voice, and sending voice messages on the ps4 worked well too.  For a few days I tried to figure things out, and I tried resetting the headphones to factory defaults in the app at one point.  This seemed to do the trick, as my friends still said my voice seemed different than normal, but not nearly as bad as it was before.At the end of the day, these are a reasonable replacement for my PX5s, though I actually prefer doing battery swaps rather than plugging the headset in while playing.  The sound is different, but still pretty good overall (probably a result of having much more EQ control on the PX5.  Surround sound works pretty well, and the quality on these are nice, though I wish there was a bit more padding on the front portion of the ear.\n",
      "23399723: Best Headset for the price! Headsets can be difficult to come by with some lower quality headsets.  But for $100 these take the cake.  One of the best wireless headesets money can buy for $100.  Also I love that they look like regular headphones without a weird design or color.  I use this for my PS3, PS4, and Vita as well as my MP3 player and computer!  Works great.  Battery life is 8 hours and is really quick to charge!\n",
      "44091367: thanks thanksand arrived in good time, recommend, excellent product, can be used on PC, Ps3, Ps4, PsVita, cell phones and BD has very good sound, the only thing wrong was the packaging for shipment which was very large and was charged higher costs because of that\n",
      "3827005: awesome!!! this speakers are the best!!!! they have perfect sound! microphone works well and the battery life is enough to play.. unless you just play for more then 5 hours a day.. Great for the price! 20 dollars cheaper then retail store\n",
      "48309149: Bad overall battery and charge port This headset was really great for a very short time. The battery is already only lasting maybe 6 hours at most. The charging cable is already coming lose and not connecting well. I am pretty upset about the quality of this product.\n",
      "48692375: I cant believe this product, PO'ed to the max. I drop $90 (correction) WITH Amazon.  Receive box, open the box all excited, charge the unit, read instructions and install the app via my PS4. Play COD, players can hear me, I can not hear them!!!!!!!!!  Upset but blame myself for not following some instruction, or so I think.  Go online to find PDF manual.  Find it.  Follow every step including one they didnt even mention elsewhere, which it to install \\\\\"factory settings\\\\\" via PS4 in order to have latest firmware.  Play COD, I can not hear players.  Wait a day cuz i'm so pissed off.  Play COD again, using mute button and other settings on the unit according to instruction.  Same result.My billable rate per hour = $120.Time it took to perform the above steps, not include the zen-time to come down from anger rush = 1.5 hours.Step 1 loss in real dollars:  $180Need to return unit now.Time to return including reboxing, going to UPS store and waiting in line as UPS store = 2 hours.Step 2 loss in real hours: $240Total loss in real dollars:  $420.This is a REAL story of real financial losses and all because I wanted a luxury item, I do not require,to help me relieve stress. Sony is an incompetent company who falsely represents product.  Xbox is in my future.Its not worth taking the risk to purchase this \\\\\"SONY\\\\\" product.  Buy a third party headset instead.Due responses from people here - I am taking Sony's misrepresentation to the next level legally.Update 6/22/14:  Played a COD tournament this weekend.  Several players used the Sony Gold headset.  The rest of the team could barely be heard.  It was so bad they had to change back to the free headset that came with the PS4.\n",

      "51325304: Great headset for a PS4 Great headset.  The sound is excellent, the controls are easy to use and they are among the most comfortable headset I've ever tried worrn.  The set is actually built to fit and adult man well.\n",
      "1657334: Great purchase Hassle free purchase. I was a bit worried about buyingbfrom overseas. The old pay the money and never see the item. But no the headset turned up within the specified shipping timeframe and securely packaged. Now trawling Amazon for my next purchase.\n",
      "49816789: Good value - but not a great gaming headset The primary reason anyone should be considering buying this headset is for gaming purposes.  For <$100, I think the value is good but not great. Will spending $25-$50 more buy you a performance upgrade to match or exceed the price difference? In my opinion, the answer is yes - I believe so. If $100 is the absolute max you have to spend, then I don't think you'll find a better gaming headset at this price. But if you can save extra cash, then I'd recommend doing so to buy a superior headset.\n",
      "24636547: Great Headset It's great. This is my first headset and a wonderful intro into gaming with a headset. The battery life is great lasts a long time and is very comfortable for long periods. The virtual surround sound completely changes gaming. Definitely would recommend, especially for those with kids. I can play when they are asleep.\n",
      "1638883: I'm very satisfied The product meets all my expectations and works perfectly, as the announcement.The quality and versatility of the phone will allow me to use in various gadgets due to its USB connection and P2P.\n",
      "7060443: All around great headset/headphones These sound very crisp and give gameplay a more realistic sound. If youve been debating on buying these I would just make the purchase and see for yourself why the ratings are so high.  They are great for plugging into your phone/tablet to.  Movies sound great with crisp bass and treble, perfectly balanced headset.\n",
      "48992973: Amazing experience, especially for the price. I received these as an early Father's Day present from my wife.  I have to say that I am VERY impressed with the immersive quality of the headset.  While I understand that the virtual surround sound is not going to have the same fidelity and detail that you might find in a multi-speaker surround sound (read: expensive) headset, the effect is amazing accurate for a two speaker system.  I am not someone who gets to spend a lot of time gaming, and have always fallen in the middle of the pack as far as my scores have gone.  Since I started using this headset, my scores have fallen within the top three in almost every round I've played.  The ability to differentiate the general area where my opponents are, while not pinpoint in accuracy, is really quite good.I've read several reviews where the chat aspect of the headset was seen as below par, but I can't say the same.  I spoke to several people on different servers and they all said that I sounded clear and had no static or distortion.  I could also still hear the game sounds very well over their chat input, too.While my head did get a little sweaty after a while, the headset is very comfortable and I had no discomfort to my ears, head, or neck. I have read reviews that they can be uncomfortable if you wear glasses, but I did not experience this at all. In fact, if it had not been for the big difference between what I was hearing and what I was used to hearing, I probably would have forgotten I was wearing it.When I first started using the headset it was easy to adjust, and the fact that all of the controls are on one ear cup made it easy to learn their position quickly, and to make any adjustments on the fly quickly and without much distraction from the game.As far as charging, it would be nice if the included USB cable were a little longer, but I guess the fact that one is included is still a bonus.  Once charged, I had no issues with having to stop gameplay to recharge even after several hours of gameplay.While I admittedly have no other experience with wireless headsets, I would definitely recommend these based on my own experience so far.  For the price, I just feel that they are a very good choice.\n",
      "1656958: defective Exactly the volume keys murmur is suspected defective returns trouble so make do with it, but there will be unpleasant situation.\n",
      "7580015: Good product Pros:- Easy to install and use;- Beautiful design;- Multiplatform support;Cons:- Very short range using wireless;- Lacks a Equalization App for Windows/Mac;- Does not support Bluetooth;\n",
      "34770335: Great Gaming Headphones These things are great. First off, they are comfortable. I could wear them for hours, no issues. The sound is crisp and much better than tv speakers. The surround sound in these works great. The chat and the hidden microphone also work very well. It takes a moment to figure out how to set the chat and game volume, but once you figure it out, it works well. The sound profiles make this even better as sony comes out with custom sound profiles for games it releases that you can simply load on with 2 clicks. I love these headphones and would recommend them to anyone, especially for the price there are offered at.\n",
      "25609738: This headset sounds great and is easy to use, but if you wear glasses or have long hair then you will experience comfort issues. For $100, you cant go wrong with this headset. Great sound quality, an acceptable microphone, and decent battery life. However, they become almost painful to wear with glasses, as they press them to your head.  Also if you have medium length to long length hair, they simply do not stay on your head and slide around everywhere.  Very annoying.  Aside from these minor annoyances, this is a great headset for the price.\n",
      "40531242: Great sound and Great quality, but... Everything is good and awesome, except the fact that if I use the headphones wirelessly there is a problem when trying to hear the ps4 sound and chat at the same time.I'm sure it's fixable using a software or firmware update but it's still a problem at the moment, so keep that in mind.There is still a fix on the web or you can just use the pl to pl cable that comes with the headphones and connect them directly to the controller.\n",
      "29289421: good but no enough Headset is realy good except one problem. battery life is too short and it dies in 2 days you need to recharge it nearly every 2 day.\n",
      "36811210: Great Headset Great Price. I previously had a Turtle Beach px21 headset... my fourth one. They worked great with good sound quality and a clear microphone. However the wires always tangled around themselves and they always broke after about a year. This year, I decided to make a change, I had seen the ads for the PlayStation Gold headset and loved the way it looked. It looks simple yet is very functional. All the controls are on the left earpiece with chat to game volume on the front and overall volume, surround sound toggle, and mic mute toggle, on the back of the left earpiece. When used in a PlayStation 4 or 3 you plug in the little usb stick that comes with it and turn the headset on. Completely wireless. When used with an iPhone, Android, computer, or other device like the PS Vita or Nintendo Wii U, you plug in the headset via a headphone jack included with the headset. The sound quality is fantastic probably better than the previously mentioned Turtle Beach px21 and the microphone is better than most online reviews give it credit for. Also the battery life is about 10 hours (noticeably longer than the PS4 controller battery), and it uses the standard micro usb that the ps4 controllers and android phones use which it comes with. Overall, if you need a headset for gaming and music, you cant go wrong with this one\n",
      "30034831: Great headphones I got these for my son and he absolutely loves them.  The surround sound is great and the quality is all Sony!!  He couldn't be happier.\n",
      "35706706: Great Product! I have nothing negative to say on this item.  The headset has a great sound and for the money it is worth it!  I just plugged the headset to my phone and the sound quality its incredible.  I dont think i can go back to my old headset.  I was reading other reviews and they were complaining about the sound being too low but i dont think that is the case.  When you are playing it is on a setting that is safe and clear for your ears but when i listen to music it sounds louder so in my opinion i think they sound great.Thanks for such a quality product\n",
      "9971411: Very pleased Very comfortable and very user friendly. Would recommend.  Can double as head phones to take on trips with included wire.\n",
      "2270602: Overall great headset for the price I bought this headset because I needed something to use to chat other than that worthless mono headset you get with the ps4 and I wanted to experience surround sound headsets.Pros:-great sound-mic works great and is hidden-comfortable to an extent-you can have it wireless or wired-super easy set upcons:-the mic can be really sensitive at times picking up slight breaths-when wearing the headset for a while, usually 2 hours or more it started to hurt my ears to the point where I had to stop using them for a bit.Overall, this headset is really good for the price. The headset did get uncomfortable after a while, but not a deal breaker. Also the battery life you get with this headset will be more than enough, unless you pull all nighters gaming.\n",
      "12661459: Excels my expectations Technically I never had a real headphone experience that this one truly supplies. I'm still spooked on how amazing it is! I use it for more than gaming, in which is a plus! The only downside is that the analog volume control isn't controlled on the headphones itself, but it doesn't matter much. Virtual surround sound is only for playstation experience, in which is fine too. The calls and anything really on it, if its wired or wireless, sounds fantastic! Even when i use it for phone calls on my cell or computer, this product astounds me!\n",
      "15716617: Excellent headset Excellent headset, the best in the market. They feal awesome and very comfortable. The shipping was great, i am more than satisfied\n",
      "5411174: Good Product Works exactly as described. Good price for a headset of this quality. Not really any complaints, Been using nightly for three months now, with zero issues.\n",
      "50646780: Awful -get the original Sony \"Wireless Stereo Headset\" instead These were simply awful, far less than what I had been expecting. I had now the Sony 1, 2 (Pulse), and now the Gold cans. The Pulses just plain hurt my ears. The Gold is better for sure - but it is NOT surround sound by any means - its all fake. The Sony 1's (the Wireless Stereo Headset) are more comfortable, they track the sound and action as well as the Gold here. They have real physical sliders (instead of the stupid up/down buttons in the Gold), and sound as good.Not sure why, the Gold headset took away the cool jack on the USB transceiver dongle. Go figure.\n",
      "11816714: great headphones! perfect for my gaming needs, upsets the family at night playing games when they are trying to sleep. this is perfect for that kind of situation. i use them outside of my gaming life as well, and they have great sound. battery life is good, don't over charge, and wait till they die to do so. WORTH THE MONEY! game on friends.\n",
      "38387052: Great headset This is a great PS4 compatible headset for only $99. Highly recommended! Sound is crispy, battery life lasts longer than similar wireless headphones and the buttons are well placed. However, if you are planning on using these headphones outside of the US, make sure you can download/use the headset companion app because being in Mexico I had to create a US account to do so and be able to customize the profiles.\n",
      "2743566: a great headset I liked it a lot, it's a great headset, from now i'm always play with it, the sound quality is amazing and it's so comfortable.I recommend it, if you like to play with the high sound fidelity, it was made for you!\n",
      "12907461: Had these for awhile now! Great product. Affordable, great bass, great highs. Very comfortable, and feels sturdy. They are light and comfy on the ears, meaning I can play for 6 hours without any discomfort or need to charge.I bought these right when they came out, not knowing what to expect. You can't argue with all the positive reviews on here. These are a MUST..ps. Just downloaded a custom profile for them for Watch_Dogs. Genius.MUST BUY!\n",
      "1702442: Very good I think the headset is very good. but sometimes I can listen some noise in virture surround system. Except that, I feel it is perfect. Thank you.\n",
      "50240687: Excellent! I liked a lot. It worth the cost. Recommended for every one who wants a very good product with a nice price.\n",
      "43951523: Very Good, but not great SUMMARYIf you want a good set of wireless headphones for your PS4, without paying a fortune, then this is a good set to buy. If you are used to something like the Razer Megalodon (coming from a PC gaming background), then you may find that these headphones don't quite deliver in sound quality or comfort.COMFORTIt is not uncomfortable by any means, but my ears did start to hurt a bit after 4 hours of play. The cushioning around the ears is not as soft and puffy as I would have hoped, and as you will find on the Razer Megalodons (PC gamers). It may not be a fair comparison, because the Megalodons is a wired set and works only with PC, but it is a set that I am familiar with and a set that some future buyer may also be familiar with. It is worth mentioning that I found these headphones somewhat heavy (you guessed it), compared to the Megalodons, but I suspect that it is because of all the controls on the headset itself (as opposed to a receiver box) and housing the battery which makes it possible to be wireless.SOUND QUALITY AND DESIGNThe bass is very good and punchy, the clarity is fairly good and you get used to the positioning of the volume and other control buttons pretty quickly. I like the fact that the ear cups feel sturdily built into the headphones and the headset looks good on virtually any person. The surround is okay, but only provides a minor positional awareness upgrade from a normal stereo non-virtual surround set. Yet again, compared to the Megalodons, you will be very disappointed with the performance of the surround if you were to make the switch from the Megalodons to this set.*Please note: My apologies for mentioning only the Razer Megalodons as a comparative headset, it is unfortunately the only other surround sound headset that I have experience with and drawing a comparison between this headset and my other plain old stereo set (Sennheizer HD 202) would just not be fair. I hope this is helpfulfor those who are switching from PC to PS4 and who are used to the [not going to name it again] headset.\n",
      "32270035: Great Headset! Using on ps3, soon ps4! I ordered this when I could get it from warehouse deals for about 20 dollars off. But Id say these are still worth retail! ($100)I will cover a few things about these in my review, but if I fail to mention anything you are curious about please feel free to ask!-Set up-Extremely easy! Just plug in the usb dongle to the ps3, ps4, or your computer! (listening to music wirelessly now)-Buttons on ears-Easy to get used to, took a little time to figure out what everything did. (Holding VSS is what turns it on and off, likewise with mute) Whenever you activate something or even change the volume there is a beep that lowers the music for about a second. This does get annoying, but I dont often change the volume after I am set.-Sound-Playing games with these is great! Sound is excellent and full. The VSS works very well, you can totally hear a difference than when it is off. The bass is clear, and explosions/ gunshots sound great! There is very little sound leak as well, so you wont be disrupting those around you. ****sound with the cable is no where near as good as it is wirelessly, This is because phones and many other audio devices do not have the power to make these headphones sound as good as they do when they power themselves.*****-Comfort-I have had these on my head for a good 3 hours straight and they dont bother me at all! (I also wear glasses so that is another factor) They are very formfitting and able to be adjusted to fit many sizes. They are also very light! (Some say they feel cheap, but i think they feel fine)-Overall Pros--Inexpensive-lightweight-great sound-easy set up-comfortable-Overall cons--battery is only about 8 hours (for me this is fine, I rarely will use them for more than 4 hours at a time)-Beeps when pushing buttons-sound quality and volume drops when using the plugin to phones or other devices.Get this headset and you wont regret it! Especially if you want to experience your games in a whole new way!.Get this headset and you wont regret it! Especially if you want to experience your games in a whole new way!\n",
      "48481611: PS4 My first gaming headset, they sound great to me! Battery life is good! Very comfy for long periods of time!\n",
      "15849414: Don't Waste Your Money The Pulse Elites blow these out of the water. Enough said trust me. More bass more response and more clarity. These are a god send I own both and wish I didn't waste my money on these but they will be a backup when my elites loose charge.\n",
      "30994959: Seems Like Great Product! I have used these a few times and they seem very solid! Great for the price and the virtual surround sound is great!\n",
      "2882073: Amazing Such good quality headphones!! 10stars and the price is perfect! If you brought this from any where else it would be way over $150\n",
      "43485559: Amaizing Look Despite the amazing look, i had higher expectations in the sound, it wasn't the smartest purchase for my PS4, was kind dissapointing\n",
      "51625581: Great job Sony Takes a little bit to setup as they did not just plug and play on the PS4. Once you get the app downloaded and then upload a preference for listening-then the fun begins. Terrific low, mid, and upper range, with great clarity. Once set into the Audio settings on your PS4 it's instant on/off with good battery life and a nice long charging cord to boot!\n",
      "27824882: Does the job Honestly, for $100 this product is fine. I wouldn't say it absolutely blows me away, but the sound quality is pretty good and they are really comfortable. All and all, I have no complaints and I think the actual design and look of the headphones are pretty sharp. It's nice not to have a huge mic boom in front of your mouth when you are gaming. I'd say go for it.\n",
      "41497029: Great Headphones for the Price I really like how the headphones fold in to become smaller, it is a very great feature. Sound Quality is great for the Price. It was very easy to setup. Design is nice, and the goodies included in the box are a bonus. Overall for the price of the product, it is a really great value. If your thinking about purchasing these headphones, I would say go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it.\n",
      "25074844: Love them!! I love the sound quality and the different settings that you can adjust to depending on the game you are playing.\n",
      "11816457: dunno what to say its comfortable however if I put my hand on the headset to adjust volume it disconnect no signal and the range isn't very good 4 meters and it keep going off and on after long use around 2 hours I get a headache.\n",
      "37015635: Great for the price Bought these from the US and shipped to UK... Still worked out cheaper than the current price at the time. Sound quality is okay - certainly good for the price and makes games a lot more enjoyable. Directional awareness using these is improved but not as precise as I expected. Extremely comfortable and set-up takes a matter of seconds. Will perhaps trade them in for superior sound quality if there is ever a similarly easy-to-set-up alternative but until sony stop being difficult about their wireless, this is great; I love them!\n",
      "63746: Sounds Great The sound is terrific while playing. It gave a different impact while you were playing. It is good for action packed games.\n",
      "34981136: Yahoo for these I like loud game playing with good sound. Since my wife isn't too thrilled about the noise these phones really do the trick. I don't think they work with the PS3 but they rock playing Assassins Creed on a PS4 and 100 inch screen!\n",
      "17729057: Good, but not as comfortable as G930 If G930 comfort is 5 stars, then this Gold Wireless is 3.5 stars.This headset is quite comfortable, but every 30 minutes of gaming, my ears sweat. With G930, that happened every 2 hours.But this headset can be used with PC, PS3, PS4, 3.5 mm jack, which is excellent. Unlike G930 that can only be used with PC.Actually, I don't like the hard material inside the earcups which touch my ears directly,I like the earcups that can covers your ears without the hard material inside press my ears.The sound quality is great, the bass is ok, the voice chat is clear.The battery life is about 10-15 hours. The charging time is 2-3 hours.\n",
      "12400151: Very pleasantly surprised by these Very happy to report that they're lightweight and large enough to be comfortable for extended periods on my giant skull. Within an hour I preferred these to my Audio Technica ATH-M50's, which do sound a little better, but I can't wear them for more than 20 minutes at a time or else I start to sweat in the ear cups.  These Playstation headphones actually sound surprisingly good for inexpensive wireless cans and the ear cups breathe so much better that almost 3 hours had passed before I remembered that sweaty ears were a problem with the Audio Technicas.  These headphones are also incredibly practical,  plug the dongle into any computer or your playstation and with a couple clicks you're good to go.They should have supplied a 3ft USB cable instead of a 1ft, but I have an old cell phone charger that I've re-purposed to charge the headphones with so I'm not too broken up about it.\n",
      "5423260: Good headphones but they leave you wanting The good: Their really comfortable, they have good sound quality and a really cool design. You could almost forget your wearing them while you play & they definitely help get you more immersed in to your game.The bad: Their not intuitive, it took like 30 minutes to get them calibrated and the directions don't help at all, its tricky adjusting your Sound to Chat volume ratio (this is immensely frustrating when you just want to game but you have to stop what your doing to mess with the headset). The bass leaves you wanting, you can hear everything great but I'd like a little more rumble.\n",
      "22255246: EXCELLENT, IS THE BEST PURCHASE COULD DO ..... RECOMMENDED 100% EXCELLENT, IS THE BEST PURCHASE COULD DO ..... RECOMMENDED 100% NICE SOUND, NICE LOOK, JUST THE BEST HEADSET EVER... (WI-FI) AT THIS PRICE....\n",

      "38377853: A better deal than the more expensive headsets Years ago, I bought a Triton 5.1 virtual surround headset for XBOX 360 that cost about $300.  The boom mic broke, followed by a quick and total failure of the headset.  The audio quality wasn't that great, anyway.  This $99 headset from Sony is vastly superior to that old Triton headset in every conceivable way -- easy plug-and-play connectivity, wireless set-up, and most importantly, great sound. The hidden mic for voice chat works great, and the audio controls, including mic mute, are easily accessible on the headset.  My only complaint that the micro USB charging cable is way too short.  Otherwise, this is a great package. Highly recommended.\n",
      "19147130: Great headset I got this for the Ps4 and to use with my smartphone.  To be honest, I don't have any other headsets to compare it to, but I think it sounds great.  Comfort is fine, doesn't feel too heavy, sized not too big or too small. just feels a little hot around the ears after a while.  It folds to make it more compact which is a really nice feature.  Wish there was a way to connect to my smartphone wirelessly but no big deal.\n",
      "19684759: the peacekeeper Bought for my boyfriend. The house is no longer filled with gunshots and police sirens. No more military comands followed by loud bangs. No longer do I wake up at 2am from the sound of a hooker's final scream or a tractor trailer truck exploding. There are no more voices of people who are simultaneously in my living room and South Carolina.A+ product. Highly recommended!\n",
      "10230882: Great product One word to describe this 'Awesome'. Its comfortable, sound quality is great, and overall a great product, no regrets whatsoever.\n",
      "14698814: I love these headphones! Well, I was saving up to buy some nice noise canceling headphones for listening to music when I got my PS4 and realized that my ps3 mic wouldn't be compatible. In my search for a new mic I can across this product.While reading the product description I noticed that these were wireless, but could also be used with an included audio wire to listen to music on other devices. I figured with these I would get the best of both worlds and boy was I right.Upon opening the package I was taken back by the nice packaging and included accessories. The sound is excellent for the price and I was surprised by the noise cancellation although they aren't active noise canceling headphones.I have not used the mic yet, and if there are any issues with it I will edit this review. As of right now I strongly recommend this product!\n",
      "43974675: Love Love Love!!!! I was skeptical about these at first but decided to get them with the 15$ price drop.  I love these headphones!! I am new to using a headset like this, I used a blutooth mic all of the ps3 era.  I decided to get something a little bit better for ps4.  The sound is great!  My only complaint is I wish the bass would be a little bit louder. I also wish the sidetone would be a little louder so you could tell how loud you are talking. Those are my only complaints. The headset is super comfortable and having some control over the audio options via the ps4 app is awesome!  Anyone that is complaining about the sound being to low is crazy! My guess is the chat control of the headset is turned up vs the in game sound.  You have to play with both settings to get the mix you want.  Dont hesitate to get this headset.  Everything works amazing for the price!!\n",
      "19405808: So Good So good. Good fit, good sound, good battery. Everything you want in a headset, it's wireless and relatively cheap. Legit.\n",
      "8797315: Coming from G930's, these DO NOT suffice They have a very muddy sound. The Virtual surround is okay, but I didn't notice much difference playing Infamous SS.The main problem is quiet sounds dont sound quiet.Example: your footsteps are as loud as someone shooting a gun next to you.Example: the guy shooting a gun next to you sounds just as loud as the guy shooting who's barely visible in the distance.I really like the build quality and materials though. If the sound was better, these would be perfect.\n",
      "51302099: Great Product, Awful Instructions! Simple to get it up and running. Works great for me since I got it so I would not bother other people with my game play. Haven't tested the mike, but the sound is great.Sony could do so much more with the app that goes along with this. After downloading the app, its not clear how you are supposed to use it. What is even worse is that the on screen labels are WRONG. They say press X when you should be pressing O. And nothing says that the headphones have to be connected via a USB cable to download the additional settings! I guess we were just expected to  figure out that a set of WIRELESS headphones would need a WIRE to work right. Go figure.So this is a good product but is marred by awful documentation and terrible quality control on the application side.\n",
      "17103068: Even Better Than I Expected I had my eyes on these for a while as I wanted to experience BF4 to the fullest AND have a wireless mic....  Well my girlfriend surprised me with them (she's cool like that, and very pretty) and I gotta say they are even better than I was expecting.I had a very nice pair of SONY stereo headphones i was using, but they hurt my ears after only 20-30 minutes, the first thing I notice about the GOLD WIRELESS HEADSET is how comfortable it is!  You really can't even tell that they are on, even after hours of gaming.The sound quality is great too, fully immerses you in your game or movie, etc.  I was also a bit worried how the mic would perform in that it might sound like i was far away from it to others i was speaking to. But nope, it sounds great and clear (as told by my friends).These headphones are VERY comfortable with great sound and have even surpassed my high expectations for them.  I highly recommend for anyone looking for a quality headset.\n",

      "37259532: Could be better............... When I first bought these I loved them. I was mostly playing Battlefield 4. One issue is that there is no bass whatsoever. They are very loud and they have nice sound quality, just no bass. Recently I started playing Call of Duty and I have been having problems hearing teammates over the game sound. The game/chat button are one in the same. So I have to choose whether or not I want to hear the game and not my teammates or vice-versa. There is no in between. So if you plan on playing games where you have to talk to people and you like bass, do not buy these. I just sold mine and got some Skull Candy PLYR1 and I love them.\n",
      "42427024: better than expected I went from an xbox 360 turtle beaches to this on the ps4 and wow what a difference. It is completly wireless and works without a hitch. the only issue i had with it was for a bout a week the game volume would not work but i later found out that was because there was a chat/sound button and i had the sound turned all the way off (blond moment).\n",
      "2282680: Excellent Very happy with the overall quality of this headset. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for good sound that doesn't want to spend too much.\n",

They can be used with your other sony devices using the companion app. They also have a line in jack to connect to other devices such as iPod, mp3, and most cell phones with headphone jack.\n",
      "11234482: gold headset best headset on the market best headset I've ever owned the sound is so picture clear definitely will recommend it again thanks again Sony for coming through\n",
      "1818481: Exlent Exlent,good,wanderful.So good sound I ever heard in mya life! I wery happy, thancky sony so much as i can only say!\n",
      "1721599: Flawless Only downside is you can't go around town wearing them as they are very big and draw attention, someone might want them!\n",
      "4331518: Can't beat the value For just $100 this is the most you will get for your money. Great sound quality, extremely easy to set up, very comfortable. They feel durable and have some great settings to play around with. If you want a good headset but don't want to pay $200+ this is what you want, hands down.\n",
      "38889850: excellent [...]Be sure to check out my video review of this product.  Its always better to see someone test it before you buy it\n",
      "47699868: Wonderful I purchased these for my boyfriend, and I'm not sure who likes them more.  If you're the one playing, the sound is awesome, and a couple games actually have a &#34;headset mode&#34; you can play on.  The sound is still very full and feels very much like you're &#34;in the game&#34; so you don't lose any of that experience.  If you're the one hoping to not listen, these are awesome, as well.  My boyfriend works until late at night, and I work early morning.  These allow him to come home and game it up while I'm sleeping and I don't hear a thing!!  He doesn't hear me complaining about the volume and he can enjoy his gaming experience, and I can get some sleep.  It's a win-win and we both LOVE IT!!\n",
      "45161363: good Real sound! Real sound! HahahaSony is always good!Ps4 user's must have item!But it has to support to asia!\n",
      "22789095: This is what you're look for... I see a lot of complaints on this product but I cannot see why. I have had these for about 2 weeks now and I have fallen in love with them. I read a complaint saying they lack bass... mine have a perfect amount of bass. If you buy these make sure you have a PS4 so you can download the companion app on the PS4 Store online. On the app you can set a custom audio preset just for you(This includes a bass level setting). I have my bass set on the highest level and they sound perfect. After setting up your custom preset you can connect these to just about any other device such as computers, cellphones, mp3s, etc. I am an avid player of games such as COD and BF and these sound very well on those and many others. The virtual surround sound doesn't hurt either. If you want to set-up the sidetone option(audio feedback of your voice through the speakers) all you have to do is hold down the \\\\\"MUTE\\\\\" button for a couple of seconds until you hear a \\\\\"beep\\\\\". All around this is a great headset that I think I will stick with for a long period of time.I give the Gold Wireless Stereo Headset 5/5 Stars... Fantastic.\n",
      "31856895: Platinum in my book Sony Gold Wireless Stereo Headset is the best headset I have ever owned for any device period. The best sound, comfortable even after 5+ hour sessions, sleek style. For the 99$ price point you will not be definitely not be disappointed.\n",
      "21794522: Bit the bullet... Sure, Sony stuck it to me and every other owner of Turtle Beach PX5 headsets with the launch of the PS4 and lack of support. That being said, I could not be happier with the quality of this headset. It feels better on the head / ears and in my opinion, sounds better in game. Now if I could only figure out what to do with this other headset...\n",
      "50579991: Nice Very nice. They are a little bigger, heftier than I thought. That's a good thing. They sound really good. Deep thundering bass tones. Nice high end &#34;directional&#34; sounds. Set up is, plug it in (usb) and turn it on, done. For the price I don't think you could do better. Gaming like it should sound.\n",
      "15274061: Love it! This headset is so awesome. It is extremely comfortable and never makes your head hot. I played with it on for at least 6 hours yesterday. It has transformed Battle Field 4 into an entirely different animal. The sounds are ridiculous and this headset sounds awesome. I am currently selling my Astro A40s because I like the wireless better. The sound is honestly about the same but the Gold is so much more comfortable. The surround sound directional sounds may be better on the A40s but these are awesome for 100 bucks. Also they work on xbox 1 and ps4 I've only used them for BF4 on my xbox 1.\n",
      "37682719: Works good. My boyfriend wanted this as a birthday present, and so he was very pleased went I got it for him. He really enjoys being able to play his PS 3 games at night went I am sleeping and not disturb me. The sound quality is great and you hear things that you would not normally hear with your speakers on the TV. It is excellent for games which require stealth as you can hear the enemy approaching. It actually makes playing these types of games better.I would recommend this product.\n",
      "45523938: Works great with Battlefield 4 for PS4 Works great with Battlefield 4 for PS4.  That's enough for it to get 5 stars from me.  It's awesome to be able to hear the game while taking a bathroom break in between games.  UPDATE: Headset broke after one year and 5 months.\n",
      "10679228: Amazing. Simply Amazing. It's insane that so much sound comes out of such a low priced product. The gold wireless headset has better quality than beats headphones at a fraction of the cost and they look cooler imo. Not to mention, you can use these on your PS4, PS3, PC, Mac, cell phone, vehicle, basically anything with a USB port or standard headphone jack. Not only does it make the explosions and gunfire much louder and more realistic, you can also hear footsteps as if someone is sneaking up behind you. On top of all of this, the music sounds amazing too! You can't beat these for $99.\n",
      "6246424: SOUND ME IN!!! A much different sound and more functions and downloads for game sounds than the other ps3 headset i have. The are both good but upgraded. Would highly recommend.\n",
      "1814483: Wow These are amazing.!!!  I should have bought them sooner...... The best headphones I've tried by far. Great for everything even just listening to music.\n",
      "20466478: Great sound! For only $100, these are phenomenal sounding!  Highly recommend. One bonus is no mic sticking out as it is an internal one.  Works perfectly.\n",
      "37352639: Good ear muffs These good ear warmings. Feel good and keep ears feeling warm. Sometimes video gaem sounds in them! I put them on my head.\n",
      "87151: worth its price this is my first headset ever so i have nothing to compare it with.i loved the design , the materials are in good quality , the sound quality is pretty good and the surround system 7.1 is greatthe battery life is fine 6-10 hours . its comfortable even if you use it for hours ( for me at least ) . i use it with ,y PS4 , PS3 , iPhone and my laptop . i'm sure there is better but with this price it is a great deal\n",
      "38169469: Can you hear me now? These headphones are great but nothing is perfect.  You get nice rich sound out of these and they seem to tune out the world around you with their extra thick muffs.  However, you can't see the volume setting so you have to guess where you are at. Other than that small gripe, these are amazing.\n",
      "30419659: Cool Very good headset clear sound really comfy so I'm happy with this purchase . May be I will one more pare for May friend on his birthday.\n",
      "23556953: Great headset I love this headset. It works really well for any use (my phone, PS3, PC, Vita.) You will not be disappointed. Thank you Sony.\n",
      "11360349: Perfect I bought this earlier today at a local gamestore and I have to say this is amazing. It came with a silk pouch to put it in with blue strings, and the headset fits perfectly in it along with the dongle, charger, and audio jack. I've used it for PS3 already and the audio quality is beautiful and crisp (I played The Last of Us) and you could hear all the details in the game, i'm currently using it on my PC which is running Windows 8 and have been using it on my PC for a couple hours, so far i'm finding no problems with it. Also it's very comfortable and doesn't irritate my head or earsI'll update this if I find any problems with it, but I couldn't recommend it enough, even if you want to use it just for PC it's worth the money\n",
      "16268374: Pretty good sound for the price, app is gimmicky These are a 100$ pair of wireless headphones so I wasn't expecting too much but they're actually pretty nice.  My favorite feature is they have a &#34;sound&#34; to &#34;chat&#34; rocker to adjust the sound of in game volume to incoming voice.\n",
      "1895872: good quality I like the sound quality of this product. Especially at night the gaming will became entertaining,also good at bluray movies.\n",
      "35726901: The best headset You'd be a fool to buy any other brand if you own a Playstation! Seamless integration to your console, exceptional sound quality, wonderful comfort, and chat capability. What more do you need?\n",
      "2803100: Excellent headset for gaming! As advertised. Great sound, and very easy to set up. I love this rig. I would definitely recommend it to any gamers out there.\n",
      "16404976: Great! Don't have too much to say about these except that they are great!  I've had a few other brands of supposedly &#34;wireless&#34; headphones and sadly none of them were actually wireless.  These are 100% wireless and the sound is incredible.  My wife goes to bed, and I can watch a movie or play a game without any worry about the loud noises from the tv!\n",
      "41580848: Almost greatness awaits! Great sound quality, comfortable and easy set up, however it would have been greater if Sony had added blutooth features in order to hook it up to any equipment with Blutooth like my TV or laptop, besides Sony's game consoles only\n",
      "21455688: Great headset for a great price These headphones are well worth the money especially with the 7.1 Dolby digital surround sound. Make sure you download the headset companion app from the PlayStation store so that you can program the headset with the specific sound profile you want. The mic works great and people can hear me clearly. I get about 8 hours of gameplay wth them before I have to charge them. The padding on the headset is very comfortable and easy to adjust for a tight or more loose fit. An extra bonus is that there's a cord and jack included so that the headset can be plugged directly into the PS4 controller. You could also use the cord to plug the headset into your phone are an Ipod, etc. All in all the headset is well worth the money and can't find any faults with the headset..\n",
      "41477856: great but i used the old stereo headset from sony for the PS3and i like it more than this one because one thing. which is when the Mic is turned on you will hear a static sound or some disturbance sounds caught from the mic and heard via the ear cupsyou will notice that clearlyi guess they built it with a bad mic in itother than that there is nothing to mention\n",
      "4269077: very good Also good, but not Bluetooth, no USB devices are not used. But the PS4 good results, it is worth buying.\n",
      "25332312: good headset for it's price the overall and quality is good. the only downside is the ear cup extension bit short, always can feel the headset against head.\n",
      "5571466: Headphone gold ps4 It good headphone go buy them best headphone every  now go buy  for yourself or somebody you will like it\n",
      "2683434: Perfect headset for playstation 4 I give it 5 stars because its value for money.Like-I like the materials used as they make the headset feel very comfortable on my head.Battery life is amazing.Its what i wanted after all.Dislike-NoneI recommend this headset for anyone looking for a wireless headset for their ps4.Its just made for it.I played COD ghosts with it and i could hear each and every footstep and in which direction they are coming from.\n",
      "5469083: Much better than expected Im a recent convert to PlayStation and my turtle beach headphone wont work for the PS4 so i picked these up and was blown away. The setup was simple as can be considering my turtle beaches took me forever to figure out with optical cables and Bluetooth, this was a pleasant surprise. I feel these are much better than the headphones i used for my Xbox which were around 50 dollars more and though the in game sound seems about the same, (both 7.1 surround sound) it seemed like the chat sound was much better that the turtle beaches. Plus there are no batteries in the headset, which sound save a serious gamer some good money over a year.Great buy, couldn't be happier, highly recommended.\n",
      "24342607: I would buy it again.. I play FPS games on PC and PS4.  I wanted a headset I could use with both.. While other headsets will work with PS4, I doubt any could be easier.. I like the ease of use..  The fit is a little Snug on my head (I've got a slightly larger then average head) and for that reason I give it 4 stars.. There's no adjust-ability with that fit the the headset.  While I use this on my PC 90% of the time,  it sounds great, and the mic quality was better then I've had in my old TurtleBeach X12's.  The difference with playing on PS4 with these is Night and Day... If your playing games like CoD without a headset your really at a disadvantage.  Buy these and be happy.. Ohhh and if they fit a bit snug... Just put them around something slightly bigger then your head while your not wearing them..\n",
      "25496358: Perfect for gaming and chat - not the most durable I was concerned about the fact that they were virtual surround but actual surround headsets cost a lot more.  These are ideal for my needs.  They provide directional noise for 1st person shooters (foot steps, bullets, vehicles...).  And they're awesome in chat too.  UPDATE - 1.5 years later they broke.  I've put a lot of hours into them so I'm not surprised and a strategically placed piece of tape will likely allow me to use them for another year or more.  It was the hinge that allows you to fold them up, which probably isn't even necessary.\n",
      "22255559: Outstanding Sound With comi from the previous edition of the sony headset to these, these are the Cadillac of headsets. Very comfortable and have the best sounds I've heard in any headset yet. The only downside is they do get a little sweaty. But that is nothing compared to the build and quality of how these function.\n",
      "47731145: this is the one you want, right here. trust me. i tried the astro a50's....and the other sony cans....then i got these. these are everything i was looking for in a headset. period. the sound is absolutely killer, they get LOUD, they are very user friendly, and the fact that i swapped out three hundred dollar cans for these hundred dollar ones should truly say something. they cost three times less but i feel they are the wayyyy better headset. period. in every aspect. these are what you want. they just don't look as cool or expensive as the astros. no one got a girl's number while wearing a gaming headset anyway so who cares what they look like. get these. trust me.\n",
      "14710826: No Regrets! I read some great reviews prior to purchasing Sony's Gold Headset. Gamers seemed happy and some even compared to Turtle Beach headsets.I used it for solo gameplay and the sound is fenomenal! You can hear everything! It's my first time playing with a headset, so excuse my excitement.I used it for multiplayer game and that's when I had a problem with the microphone (or so I though). My friends could not hear me, I sounded far away. Well two things, this was prior to the PS4 system upgrade on 04/30/14, which that update included options for mic control and volume control for headset within the console. Second, I was wearing the headset backwards! So, after correcting my noob mistake and adjusting microphone setting, eureka! It's amazing. I can now hear enemies approaching in multiplayer games and chat away with other players about killing them.I'm completely satisfied with this purchase; not as expensive as other headsets and great quality for both surround sound and chat. Kudos Sony!!\n",
      "12832299: Excellent Purchase! Very satisfied!!!!!  They were as advertised!  Purchased them as a gift and my brother absolutely loves them!  Would purchase again!!!\n",
      "33413179: Works great for the PS4 I've had no issues so far, works great with the PS4 right out of the box and you have options to download sound profiles from PSN.\n",
      "37458240: Great Value for gamers! They headphones feel and sound great. Love the easy set up and while it doesn't have all the profile of the turtle beach headsets the two it has are good. You got one basic profile and one customized preset. Sadly you have to connect the to change the preset but it's quick and easy with the headphone app on the PS3/PS4. The 7.1 surround sound also add to enrich the gaming or movie watching experience. I love the fact that these headphones can be used with both consoles (PS3/PS4), my PC, Tablet, Phone, and Vita with either the USB dangle or standard 3.5mm jack. Great Value, Fit and Sound for the Price!\n",
      "50890557: Good for what they are. I have a rather large collection of headphones, DACs, and Headphone Amps and I am on a constant quest for headphone perfection (within my budget).  These certainly aren't made for any critical listening, but they never claim to be.  When it comes to gaming without disturbing the whole house they work very well. I like that these work so well with the PS, the fact that they are wireless, and that the battery is rechargeable.  I do wish the overall frequency response was a bit wider (especially on the low end) but the sound really puts you into the environment which is what they were designed to do.  Well build and worth the $100 IMHO.\n",
      "20256298: Best bang for your buck Best head set yet it's very good it last for eight hours it's light weight foldable and you can use is it as a wired headphone for a peripheral like the vita.\n",
      "2740610: Great headsets Great headsets but the battery time on the headset dies off soon and recharging takes time but overall bang for buck\n",
      "52287139: Fantastic quality This is the first large headset I have purchased...I tended to use the earbuds or bluetooth devices to listen and chat with friends.  I found with this headset that I was missing out on a lot.  The construction and easy to learn controls on the headset are both tops.\n",
      "15068803: Best cordless headset on the market! I've purchased a couple pair of cordless headsets in the past.  They're all garbage.  They're expensive and don't work all that good.  I bought one pair that $200!  It was junk.  It would make this really annoying scratch sound intermittently.  With these, you get a long battery live, an invisible mic that works great, and great sound.  I own two of these now.\n",
      "46767245: Was great for first hour of use then... The sound began to become distorted and have a popping noise intermittently. I was hoping this would subside but after a couple of days later with only maybe 4hrs total of use the problem continued of and on. I am exchanging this with Amazon and hoping the replacement headset does not do this. If it does then that is it for this headset.Aside from this issue I enjoyed the headset. Easy to setup and use with some nice features. Good bang for the buck.I will update after I have put some hours on the replacement headset and change my rating accordingly.\n",
      "7748229: Awesome I've never owned surround sound wireless headsets before. But this one and for the price, looks and sounds awesome when i play my ps4.\n",
      "20185036: Better then turtle beach!! Bought these for my husband as a gift not realizing he had purchased the turtle beach ones for the PS4 he returned them after one weekend of gaming with these the quality with them is much better and when I'm sitting next to him on the couch I can't hear the guys online talking to him like the turtle beach ones (makes for a happy wife)\n",
      "31696961: If only the microphone worked better The Good:- Comfortable- Ergonomically pleasing- Wireless AND it holds a charge for quite some time- Noise cancel- Great receptionThe bad:- Microphone reception: I've had numerous friends tell me I sound like I'm speaking underwater. When testing the microphone with a sound recorder, it sounds fine but when on Skype calls or using my PS4, my friends tell me I sound robotic. I'm not sure if it's the wireless connection or something else but I just end up plugging in my usb microphone into my playstation.\n",
      "42203082: solid and easy to use Good sound quality - the virtual surround sound work especially well - and no setup required, just plug the receiver in and go. Pretty comfortable, but still got a bit painful after an hour and a half or so, like every other headset I've ever used. I was concerned about the microphone placement - being built into the edge of the left side - but it picks up everything at a normal speaking volume. Not quite perfect, but definitely recommended.\n",
      "50927444: Pretty good Not perfect, but probably the best value proposition.  Wish the audio were slightly better and hope that Sony adds support for surround sound on PC.  Overall 4.5 stars for PS4 use, 3.5 stars for laptop use.\n",
      "2614678: For the players A grate item for gamers recomended to all those who want a grate game sound. if i could add more stars i defently would.\n",
      "51906989: Great headphones. I strongly recommend Fantastic. Don't believe the bad reviews. I don't know what the person who said the volume was too low was talking about. If u need to play with the volume all the way up on these headphones u should b less concerned about the headphones and more concerned about your hearing. The surround sound is great, battery life is great, the chat works great and of course the volume level is great. I think the bad reviews r from people who don't know how to use them. The volume on the backside of the headphones is for the overall volume of both chat and game. Then on the front of the headphones u can adjust the chat or the volume to balance both the chat and game out. Plus u should download the headset companion app so u can adjust the settings of the headphones either to your liking or u can select settings that the developers of the game u r playing have put in the app. The only thing with that is make sure your headphones r plugged in to the USB for your controller or the one it comes with when u download the sound settings from the headset companion app or it will not work.\n",
      "1957485: Its great the headset is comfortable and sound quality is nice but it is best when using with the game recommended audio settings like in infamous second son\n",
      "15429895: Awesome! I bought these about a month ago and I am very impressed with how well the sound quality is. They are comfortable and I am able to wear them for a long time on those long gaming nights. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who has a ps4 or ps3 and wants to have all the gaming sound in your ears.\n",
      "38084398: A surprisingly very good headphone! I got my Gold Wireless Headset two weeks ago and since then I have been playing inFamous Second Son with them and I really have to say that my gaming experience has been quite amazing, with this headset you can catch those little sounds that otherwise you would not catch with your TV Speakers, you definitely get a truly immersive gaming experience.One thing that got me worried at the beginning was the battery life but I found to my surpise that a full charge lasts 8 solid hours which is pretty nice I would say.LIKE- Amazing and immersive sound.- A beautiful sleek design.- They are comfortable enough to wear for hours!.- Battery last 8 solid hours.DISLIKE- Nothing comes to my mind at this moment, you get a pretty solid headphone for a really good price.\n",
      "24954449: LOVE IT Any Gamer that wants to enjoy the gaming experience should get this headset.It is worth its price. the surround system is very convenient..\n",
      "3366438: It actually came earlier than I thought it would come! I love this headset! The stereo is breathtaking! Highly recommend it to any PS4 owner! It is really worth $99!\n",
      "2668395: Great item love it. Great item I love it the sound I great. It takes time to understand it. I totally recommend.  Love it\n",
      "4336699: First-class thing Good goods. It is pleasant to carry and a sound excellent. I play practically always them. Met expectations.No problems are present.\n",
      "3105441: It's good sound is just fine.just one of item for PS4, I think.I do not want to use in outside.\n",
      "6105679: Great headset for money Even though the bass is not as deep as I would like this headset is amazing especially for the money. It has long battery life (about 8-9 hours) and is wireless not to mention is sounds great. There is not much out there that can top this headset for about $100. I highly recommend this headset. By the way if you have a ps4 get the headset companion app that has pre set settings for games. It makes the headset sound a lot better and you can customize you own settings as well. Hope this helps!\n",
      "21976117: Good For $100 you cant complain, they work fine and sound grate and the battery lasts for 9 hours sometime, and verey easy to us plug and play in PS3 and PS4 and PC.\n",
      "44979786: best Cheap and good not the pest but if you think about the price I recommend it thanks Sony for this .\n",
      "20970255: Good for the price tag Easy to connect and use. Can wear for long time with out any difficulty.  Sound wise it's ok for a $99 headset but sound not as good as my tritton pro +\n",
      "42834226: I am very impressed I got this headset because my old ones simply stop worked correct and I didn't want to spend too much money.First off this headset is very comfortable and over all feel amazing. The inner top is extremely soft and the ear pads are soft as well. They cause little to no problem while wearing these for extended periods of time.Other plus is when I found out that this headset comes with a little Playsation bag for the headset to go into. I was a little confused at first seeing how the headset was larger than the bag, but then I quickly realized they fold up at each ear piece.The sound quality is really good for the price you can get these things at. I was actually very surprised because it was better than my old headset.I also like the fact all I have to do is plug in the USB into my Ps4, turn my headset on, and i'm ready to go. It's also made me very happen to know it works with my computer as wellAll and All the Gold Wireless Stereo Headset is now one of my favorite headsets and unless something happens to these, I don't think i'll be buying another headset for a very long time.\n",
      "19844730: Ths headset works for everything I use This headset is incredible for the price. Connects to the ps4/ps3/pc effortlessly, and even works on xbox one with the headset adapter and most cell phones/tablets. The charge easily lasts long enough for a gaming session and charges within a couple hours. I love these and use them for just about everything.\n",
      "47079000: Surprised I am not an audiophile by any means, but I have owned numerous decent earphones and headsets. I was a bit hesitant to commit this much money for game-only purpose but once I tried this on, it won be over. First the comfort. I have a big head, and my previous experience with headsets is after about 10 minutes of usage, I would feel pressure either on my ears or top of my head. But this all went away with this headset and I have worn these for a prolonged period of time (1-2 hours) without any discomfort.The sound quality is great for the price. Every gun fire and steps are clear, and I noticed some sound effects I did not hear through my earphones. Sound is loud and I had to adjust the volume quite a bit, but this is a pro, not a con. The mic is hidden and it works well as nobody has complained about what I am saying.The headset works via USB attachment to either a PS3 or PS4 wirelessly. It also includes regular 3.5mm cable that can be attached to the headset and used with other devices, such as a Vita, PC, or your phone. I highly recommend the headset for its comfort, quality and convenience.\n",
      "33208346: Really nice headphones. These headphones are very comfortable on your ears after hours of gaming. The battery life last as expected about 8-9 hours easily. The sound on 7.1 Surround Sound is crazy loud while gaming I have to turn it down some. Don't ask just buy you won't regret it.\n",
      "44817868: Review after 1 month ownership I really like this headset!! I was a long time owner of Turtle Beach but with their faulty earpiece design (if you own them you know) it was time for me to try something else. These are super freaking nice. Easy set up, feels durable, comfortable (I have a big head and fits fine) the bag it comes with is nice for storage but seems redundant for everynight use though.The controls on the left earpiece is suuuuper cool, mute for when GF is talking to me, volume for music/games, the sound/chat button is nice for certain games.I did notice a &#34;smell&#34; which with certain electronics is normal for like the first couple nights but now a month later its gone and I use these every night.Easily worth the money in my opinion!!Cheers\n",
      "50523815: Definitely worth it Works perfectly. Comfortable on my head and the signs quality is excellent. Makes gaming a great experience, especially of you are up late and live with roommates like myself\n",
      "17167552: So glad I bought these. I've had Trittons and Turtle Beach headsets (both broke after about 7 months) and I love these way more than I ever liked those and they are about half the price. I love the wireless and the fact that you can charge them without constantly replacing batteries. The packaging is superb and sound is amazing. Friends say they can hear me great (without a lengthy microphone like on the Trittons) and I can use the bathroom probably 35 feet away through 3 doors with no lapse in sound quality when I'm leaving my friends hanging mid-game while playing Call of Duty.\n",
      "43477154: Beat value For $99 this headset is an  awesome value, other headsets this good are $200+. I get directional hearing for in game sounds, I can clearly hear other players through chat, and I've not had any complaints in regards to people hearing me. Great headset.\n",
      "20363995: Great buy. Works great with my PlayStation 3 and my Playstation 4.  With my computer the sound is clear and others can hear me just fine.\n",
      "11581338: Great headphones for a good price This headphones rock!. I bought the skullcandy slyr and they were ok but they were to tigh for my ears since I got dumbo large ears. I decided to returned the headphones and give this headphones a try and I have to say that they clearly look like a $300 headphones with the construction and sound. I wouldn't be mad or complaint if sony one day decide to increase the price they are worth more than $100. If you play FPS games and don't want to expend to much money get this headphones. Sony put a lot of work into this headphones.\n",
      "12572112: Good headset It's all in one.  As good for the PS3 or 4 and the PC.  Only problem, my PC do not recongnize automaticaly the headset.The sound is good, the headset confortable and  the price is fare.\n",
      "46405766: Great headset for only 99$ !!! Excellent. For only 99 usd, you'll get wireless audio not only on your PS3 / PS4, but also on your computer. You can use it also with other devices via the 3.5 mm jack. The audio is better than I expected, the only downside is that most of the parts are made out of plastic, but for the price you can't ask for more! I recommend this headset to everyone.\n",
      "2715218: A great headset for the price. Its a great wireless gaming headset. Fits comfortably over my head and looks slick. The 7.1 surround sounds brings a whole new depth while playing games and also the sound doesn't disturb anybody around you. I recommend this headset if you a looking for one.\n",
      "11546610: Top For the price am sure you can not find better, and you can use with you phone or tablet  , the song is perfect , specially when you play action games I recommend to every ones\n",
      "50709349: They're OK A few things not so good about the product. First the usb stick doesn't light. I like that in logitech. Also there is no warning light when battery is running low. Otherwise they are ok\n",
      "51769368: great gaming headphones Great sound quality, interfaces with the ps4 and ps3 flawlessly. Have not used the mic so can't comment on that but very satisfied overall. Have not run into battery life issues but I only pay a few hours at a time then it's plugged back into the ps4 to charge so YMMV.\n",
      "2500606: Amazing headsets with a great price one of the best headset i ever had ..When you compare to the old one there is a lot of things you will notice like its com compatibility,  It's so much lighter than the old one,  The sound is great and the surround sound is beautiful, everything about it is amazing, the headband is padded probably,  the ear cups feel comfortable and it doesn't squeeze your earIt's good headset with a great price which everyone can afford it is a good choice for gaming\n",
      "27003328: Great Headset This thing is working out awesome. The virtual sorround sound is a nice touch on this headset. Everyone can hear me crystal clear on the other end. My brother also purchased one and I can hear him crystal clear. This thing stays charged for a few days, but I guess that depends on how much you play. The carrying bag it comes with a nice touch. The ear pieces are very comfortable and I never have to adjust these due to being uncomfortable. The reciever picks up the headset anywhere in the room and almost all the way acrossed the house.\n",
      "9959076: 99$ Well spent Coming from a guy who uses the pulse elite headset for the ps3 and the ps4, i had my doubts upgrading especially since i heard alot of people complaining regarding cheap quality built, which for me is a problem because i usually wear and remove the headset quite often like when i have a call, use the toilet, etc, and the second issue was that using the Pulse elite headset, i used to have alot of interference which used to cut off sound completely for 3-6 seconds every now and then, which am not absolutely sure why!, but purchasing this headset solved that problem and let me tell you guys, it is awesome, and you wont regret the purchase, as i know that most headset and atleast 1.5 times the price. hope this helps !\n",
      "12439509: Right box, wrong headset I returned the head set I got. It was missing two very important parts in the un opened box. I waited a week to get those after a week waiting for the headset. When I finally got the parts... the wireless adapter and the power cord.. They both were for the Gold Wireless headset.. the problem was... Sony had packed the wrong headset in the right box.  I returned the headset.. to Dream Kitty, who I must say, were very nice.. that's why I gave this a 3 star... instead of 1. They've sent me my refund... in a timely manner..\n",
      "28091272: Great update! Sold my first Sony Playstation Wireless Edition and bought this brand-new &#34;ears&#34;. Great new PS4 design, well packed with all necessary things such as audio 3.5 mm jack cable for mobile devices. Using them with my PS3 without any problems. Sound is 4+, the battery lasts about 8 hours and also hidden microphone. Very compact!\n",
      "1929549: good price :) very goodi love it :)ty Gold Wireless Stereo Headsetlightweightlong working hoursand good price :)point is 9/10\n",
      "44569109: for the price... the ps gold's are worth it. the sound, and the added audio packages you get with a free download from the ps store, make this a great system to have. if for no other reason than it is compatible across all platforms. one headset to rule them all. go figure\n",
      "18714833: Amazing! I play Playstation games and watch movies in surround sound with this headset! :) Definitely worth it! Worth $100 easily!\n",
      "4127990: A great headset at a great price! I had been looking for my first pair of headphones for about two months when I saw these advertised. I'm not an expert on headphones or sound quality but these are perfect for me. I knew that i wanted a comfortable headset with surround sound that worked on the ps4 and ps3, but i didn't want to spend a ton of money. At only $100, they really fit my needs.Pros: - Sound quality (from a non-expert) - Comfortable (even prolonged wear) - Surround sound is good (not like multiple speakers in one ear, but it still works the way it should) - Easy sync to ps4 and ps3 - headphone jack (plugs into any phone, computer, PS vita, or anything else with a 3.5 mil. jack)Cons: - No voice feedback (It is awkward not hearing your voice to gauge it, but I learned to overlook it) - Usb port needed to use (This may change in the future, thus I will update this, but it doesn't effect me as a single player)\n",
      "28079741: Pretty good buy Comfortable to wear for awhile and has a relatively quick charge, 3 hours or so. Also a plus is that it fits samsung phone chargers, the cord that come with it is like 8 inches long if that. Connects good with my ps3/4, I can hear my friends through it clearly and the sounds are crisp. Also it is customizable with the ps4 headset app. Comes with a carry bag for it and a head jack cord for phones or such.\n",
      "19930185: Wish they were a little bit bigger As I mentioned in one of the comments for a review, I wear a size 8 1/8 hat, so many times headsets don't fit because they are too small. These headphones a big enough, I'd like them to be maybe a little bigger so they would give me a bit more wiggle room. Overall I am satisfied with the quality of the sound.\n",
      "37611951: The Microphone Sounds Horrible. It's got 1 tiny hole for Mic. I hear buzzing noises. It's fine if you use the provided cable for sound but not really, the mic is horrible and it is hidden in the speaker head. It sounds worst than my 1 hole computer mic. Dragon works weirdly, it does text say what I'm saying. Also there is a buzzing noise at some times.I wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "19332742: Worth twice the price These headphones are really great!! easy to setup, great sound and really long battery life make these a great buy. I've worn these things for over 3 hours and my ears never got sweaty and still had over 50% battery life. Very light and comfortable they are as high quality as Turtle Beach headphones that cost twice as much. Well Done Sony!\n",
      "3022258: husband is happy. I bought these for my husband. He loves them. They are super comfortable. They block out background noise. The sound quality is great. Great product and super fast delivery.\n",
      "38966720: More than my expectation Depand on its cost it is worthMore than my expectation infact not like Astro a50 but it is usefull\n",
      "38060863: Decent head set for the price This head set is of a well crafted design and so easy to set up,the sound from them is very good and they sit comfortably on your head i'd recommend this headset\n",
      "16289844: These are fantastic headphones! PROS:- Fit great!- Work wirelessly with PS3/PS4/PC- Work with any other device that has a headphone inputCONS:- The wireless relies on a RF adapter and not bluetooth. Would've been nice to use these wirelessly with anything bluetooth.- The surround is virtual 7.1, which you can use on PC but it takes a little bit of tinkering to get right.Other than that this is a really awesome headset and I highly recommend grabbing it!\n",
      "13691935: AWESOME HEADSET DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER!!!!!! I can break this down very easy for anyone that is looking for a awesome headset.I will put these in order of importance to me.1.Comfort - can't hardly tell you have them on.2. Sound - 7.1 way better than stereo for shooters, they sound awesome from that aspect.  I have not used a $300 set but I am not sure what else you can really ask for out of a headset sound for games.3. Connectivity - don't see how it can get any easier, move one button and you hear gold. (charging cable could be longer for playing and charging at the same time but that is what extension cables are for)Overall if you are looking for a awesome headset for gaming don't waste anymore time looking just buy these....oh yeah there is no way these should ever get less than 4 stars\n",
      "49523921: 5 star Excelent product and quality. It has everything it says it haves.i use if for everything , everyday at ecery hour.\n",
      "42894909: Top of the line The best headset I have ever used.when I first used this headset the chat and the game were clear. The headset was very comfortable\n",
      "49134541: A MUST-have for all PS4 owners These are the best console headphones I've ever owned. They connect instantly every time. They sound fantastic. The volume etc. are easy to adjust. They feel great. Worth every penny for me.\n",
      "5969553: I love it I have nothing bad to say about this wireless headset your going love it.It's a must have if you love games and music\n",
      "31404828: Good headset for the price. Pros:-Good sound when used during gameplay-Comfortable-Interchangeable plates on the side to customize your headphones-Hidden mic-Wireless-Good battery lifeCons:-Wireless USB dongle (should be bluetooth instead)-Doesn't sound all that great with other device (cellphone)-Feels a bit cheap-The fold in headphones feel like they won't last long-Still unclear on how to use the mic/sound button on the side; doesn't seem to work correctly or hasn't received support for it's use yet-Channel 1 of settings isn't programmable with the Playstation App.\n",
      "3294881: great for gaming & music the gold are by far the best headphone I've ever used and can compete with beats not to mention the great price of 100 bucks definitely a buy\n",
      "4192127: Excellent Headset for my PS4 and Ps Vita I liked this headset, in my opinion the relationship between quality and price is excellent! You can use it without cables with your Ps 3 or Ps4 and it is also compatible with phones and Vita by jack.\n",
      "14804073: Impressive Quality, Absolutely Worth It When I first turned these on, I thought I was still hearing my home theatre system. I got these to keep the noise level down while the wife is sleeping, and now I like the audio from them better than our soundbar.Worked out of the box. I had to turn on audio for headsets in the settings menu and nothing else. Comfortable, good looking, nice build quality/feel. These are an expensive accessory, but they are full on headphones thanks to the 3.55mm jack, which elevates them to mid-range professional quality headphones.\n",
      "16434452: Love 'em I think these are a great buy. I love them. Excellent quality, price, functionality, and sound. In my opinion they are better than any Turtle Beach set.\n",
      "22939934: An Easy Headphone Investment The key factor with the headphones is the mute button. I usually play my PS4 with the audio going to headphones and the problem I faced with online gaming was most headphones don't feature a mute button. That and the supplied chat mic only had one earbud. These wireless headphones have surprisingly good sound quality and a mute button to keep ambient noise out of your mic chatter. Additionally the headphones come with a plug to use with other devices like a desktop, laptop, ipod, PS Vita, whatever. In truth yes there are headphone out there with better audio quality but not for this price. Simulated 7 point surround with wireless and plugged options, these headphones come in pretty handy.\n",
      "51596972: Good, if you don't have surround and better than the included headset The sound on this thing is better than the critics (such as IGN) would have you believe. It's not perfect, and it isn't great, but it's better than nothing, and it doesn't pick up everything in the room around you as bad as the included (wired headset) that comes with the ps4 console.\n",
      "43334217: Some Issue The wireless is indeed what i wanted for the price it was at, but at times the headset becomes uncomfortable for me to wear for long periods of time.\n",
      "17615733: best headset I have ever had its a really cool headset. its very comfortable you can hear really well and people can hear you even better. It does not have that stupid mike that sticks out that makes you like you are from office space movie and it is very easy to operate set up etc. Its a Sony baby!\n",
      "2227862: Gold Wireless Stereo Headset is Golden. Awesome sound, however, it does  seem a bit flimsy, I've been handling it with extra care, so its all good. Would have been 5 stars, but the battery seems a bit low, all said, great bang for buck.\n",
      "19465745: Amazing I was very impressed with the Gold headset after my initial purchase.  Setup is a breeze- I think I spent less than 2 minutes getting the headset up and running.  The unit is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.Although my initial impression was good on games like COD: Ghosts and AC4, it wasn't until playing inFAMOUS: Second Son with the headset that I was truly blown away.  The 7.1 virtual surround sound makes Second Son come alive in a way you can't experience when hearing the game strictly through your television's speakers (although my TV also has VSS).  I haven't checked for custom profiles for Second Son yet, but the default profile is amazing.I would definitely recommend this headset for anyone with a PS4 who is wanting to hear the game as the developers intended the game to be heard.\n",
      "1964115: Great! Hi to everyone, Its my first headset for my PS4 and i realy love it. I like its voice and bass level also. I cant compare it with Elite Pulse, because i did not try that but i can easily say that close your eyes and get this Gold Wireless.\n",
      "12837340: Look no further! I bought this headset because I wasn't happy with the Turtle Beach P4C I had purchased with my PS4. Not only is this cheaper than any other stereo surround sound headseat out there. It looks nicer and functions a lot better too. You'd be crazy to pass on this.\n",
      "8850234: great headset it's really nice headset comparison of the price, but I had headache playing this with battlefield 4. overall it's okay\n",
      "8897617: Simple and Awesome Received the headphones a day after ordering them and they are perfect! Pairing them with my computer was simple and now I can game with 7.1 surround sound all day.\n",
      "15098164: Great PS4 accessory If you have a PS4 then you need this headphone and mic combo. Works flawlessly and is very comfortable. Audio quality is outstanding.\n",
      "2932909: very good headphones I absolutely love these the fact that i can wear these when my little daughter is asleep and play my games listen to music are watch movies is great. I would definitely recommend them to others.\n",
      "33069903: Awesome Headset for a reasonable price - Updated This headset is a wonderful piece of equipment.  I haven't used a nice headset before for gaming but I love this one.  I loved using this while playing through The Last of Us.  I could hear in every direction where the enemies were located.Pros:Good Sound qualityGood battery lifeEasy volume/mute controlComfortable and easily adjustableCon:Charge cord provided is too shortUpdate:  Headset broke on me recently...it has gotten a lot of use since I bought it so it was still worth the money.  I just wish they would have used more durable material.  The bezel on the right side cracked and broke.  I loaded on some electricians tape and salvaged it...still works well.  Dropping two stars just because it broke.\n",
      "43376290: If you have a PS3/PS4 get this headset, even if you don't you might want to consider them Fantastic headphones. I bought these to use with my PS3, PS4 and Vita so I guess I am the target demographic - although at this price Sony should try to target non-Playstation users as they are great all around.Comfort - Great, even though they are plastic they feel solid. The plastic does also contribute to them being low weight which I appreciate. The cups are very large and extend a ways behind my ears to rest on the back of my head which is interesting, I haven't had cups this large before.Sound Quality - I would put these headphones below my Audio Technicas in terms of overall sound but that does not mean they are bad at all. I didn't want a studio headset to use with my PS4. I wanted a headset that was comfortable for long gaming sessions and would deliver crisp audio with booming explosions. This Headset delivers in every aspect. I would put sound quality of the Gold headset well above any other on-ear or in-ear products I have (except for the ATs). For an apples-to-apples comparison to another gaming headset, Sony's blows the Razer Krakens I just got last week (Gold Box deal) away. The Razer Kraken Pro doesn't even come close to the sound quality on the PS4 or when I compared them with Diablo 3 on PC. The Krakens also were not nearly as comfortable.Extra Features:Wireless - Fantastic, tested on PS3 and PS4, plug and play. This was the #1 feature that caused me to get these so quickly after picking up the Razer Kraken.7.1 Surround - As other reviews have said it seems to be a matter of preference. I have turned it off while playing Dark Souls 2 as the audio jumps around a bit and on screen menu actions sound weird to me. It was more distracting than helpful. I'm interested in testing it out with Infamous.Bass Boost - Since they are powered when wireless, leaving the headset on the #2 setting for the bass boost is noticeable and a great feature.\n",
      "9822241: Great sound! The sound from these headphones is incredible! They're very comfortable and the microphone works well. My husband uses them with his PS4, but I borrow them for my work conference calls because they're so comfortable! Great for music too.\n",
      "3323781: headset this sounds great, low bass has 2 setting for bass, low and  very low. I think you can down load a equalizer app.\n",
      "33107365: Excellent device - the way games were meant to be heard. I really, really, like this headset.  The sound quality is excellent to my ears.  They are very comfortable, the noise canceling works great, the controls are simple, and wireless cuts all the annoying cords.  The only thing keeping it from getting 5-stars for me is the setup wasn't well documented in the instructions.  For PS3 they paired right away, but for PS4 you need to go into a submenu and enable them.  This is something I had to Google on the forums to figure out.  It shouldn't have been that hard.  The only other thing I noticed bad is an occasional and momentary sound cut out.  This may only be when the batteries are low, but either way it's only a minor annoyance - nothing nearly as bad as tangled cords to put away.  Get these headphones - you won't regret it.\n",
      "3381704: The best Excelent sound good quality and good price nice color easy to use i recomender to every one to buy this headphones\n",
      "5285238: Work Great!!! I recommend to anyone Because they do what they are supposed to do an they are wireless. Well worth the money no joke hell I'm satisfied\n",
      "25475966: Great Welcome back to the 80's when u had real sound in ur ears i love music and my ps4, talk about being able to hear everything they are a little bulky but i can go from gaming to music on my phone in a second. Good by ear buds back to headphones can't even hear the wife. Great\n",
      "17065998: Well worth the money They sound good and are priced right.Even works on the xbox one with their adaptor and included cord,chat and all...\n",
      "2645261: Good Just hope they last... The headphones came in a box WAY too big for the headphone size... but they are great. People always complain about the dongle that you have to plug into usb to use. But that just simply means you can use this thing for your computer to play an MMO or on your PS4 to play BF4 Great plug-and-play. One thing that is funny in BF4 the ))) symbol doesnt show when you speak but friends say they can hear me. On team speak or vent it came through clear as a bell on the playback test...\n",
      "4456968: Awesome! Awesome headset! Works on my PS3/PS4 and PC amazingly! Good work Sony! Would give it 5 stars but I believe nothing in this world is perfect.\n",
      "49207492: coming from having the pulese elite they feel great on the head and the sound is clear, the only thing the pulse has better is the pulse effect on the ear and the design. will have to test out if they last longer on a full charged than the elite. but so far everything about it is good.\n",
      "22288783: fantastic got these as a replacement for my Turtle beach PX5 for playstation 4. these headphones are much better then px5s. much better and more accurate directional sound. very crisp and clear. a lot of base. even too much, i had to tone down the base via the app that i downloaded from PS store. totally programmable via the app. you can program and style the sound depending on the games you play like FPS, racing, fighting, etc or just make a custom equalizer. via a free PS4 app that u get free on the PS store.totally wireless, sound and chat.no interference with nearby wifi connections like i had with px5s. very crisp and clear sound. no static at all.internal 8hr battery uses micro USB (same as the DS4 controller) and can be recharged while u're playing.dont have to charge it via PS4, u can use any micro USB wire and charge even with your phone charger from an outlet.no set up required, just plug in the dongle and u're ready to go.nice clear internal mic. highly recommend.\n",
      "15502729: Bought it, never regret it Doubt would anybody read this since there are so many reviews, just wanna say that it's a great headset for that price, very comfortable and it doesn't interfere with wife connection, unlike ps3 headset.\n",
      "18271390: Best Bang 4 the Buc These new wireless headphones are awesome.They really crank up really loud. The sound these headphones produce is so balance you wouldn't even believe it, to you hear it. Battery life on these things are excellent.If you're looking for a great pair of headphones for your PS4..What are you waiting on. Click and buy. You want be sending these headphone back.\n",
      "33268510: Quick Delivery Excellent Condition My only complaint on the product is that the charging cord it comes with is about 3 inches long.  Seriously?  I guess they want you to purchase a new cord or not charge it while you are wearing it.  They work amazing however and so I recommend getting them.\n",
      "47204767: Great headset! I never used any headset with my consoles before. So nothing to compare. But overall sound is promising. Didn't expect more.\n",
      "30485102: Comfortable and great sounding! I live in a small apartment building so it's nice to not be paranoid about bass levels late at night, or fire up an action game, or move,  late at night when the live-in girlfriend is sleeping. It's also nice to get my game on with a headset that also blocks out ambient noise, like the barking dogs of neighbors, or people who haven't figured out that when you live in a building with other people it's considerate to NOT slam your door. These headphones have been a blessing on all fronts.As many other reviewers have said they are plug and play. The blutooth USB dongle plugs into your PS4 system, you put the headphones on your head, and power them up...away you go without hassle or drama.Do download the latest drivers and the companion app for the PS4: it lets you assign a sound profile to the headset. Certain games, such as Infamous: Second Son (great game!) have their own unique sound profiles that you can assign to the headset.The headset instructions don't say this, but in order to download custom sound profiles the headset MUST be connected to the PS4 with the supplied cable in order for it to work. It can't do the job wirelessly. Other than that they are completely wireless.I'm no audiophile but I do have a decent soundbar system with a beefy subwoofer when I'm not using these headphones. With the headset on you notice subtle environmental sounds that you'd never hear otherwise. This was tested on Tomb Raider, Resogun and Infamous. If you're not an audiophile I can't imagine a better value at $99 bucks. These headphones have great lows, highs and mids for the price (and once the firmware is up to date) and I've worn them for up to 5 hours with very little discomfort.A lot of reviewers have trash talked the build quality. They seem fine to me. You're either wearing them, or they're sitting on your coffee table. They seem sturdy to me. Don't throw them against the wall?TLDR: Buy these, they sound great, are comfortable, and I can't imagine getting a better set of casual headphones at $100.\n",
      "2631207: Best thing I've gotten  for the ps4. It's a good head set you just have to get used to the settings y can very easily droun the Mic\n",
      "45335470: Good Value These are a very nice pice of kit.mi would give it a 5* rating but for a couple of minor quibbles. If you game for a long period of time (3-4 hrs) they can become a little uncomfortable, I use them late at night and because I cannot hear myself talk through the headset like my PX21's I tend to speak rather loudly and wake people up, they are well made but would be worried about the hinges , they would not take a lot batering before the broke. That said I am very happy with them. The sound is excellent for gaming and movies. The virtual sound is fantastic. The 8 hr battery life quoted is about right, and the downloadable app allows you to programme the sound. For the money they are an excellent headset and I doubt you will get better for the price.\n",
      "10074592: Gold Wireless Because this is an awesome item! If you're looking for the best in headphones for video games this is it! Deep low end & you fill every explosion every shot! !I am very impressed!\n",
      "41531657: Very useful It is compatible with PS3, that is for sure, but it is compatible with my PC too, that's amazing.I can hear where the sound of steps are, where the guitar or drum on the stage.And most important at all, it is not expensive!!\n",
      "39640965: For everyone searching for REAL quality differences betwen Pulse and Gold Having both of this headphones i can say that:+ GOLD are much more lightweight and comfortable than pulse+ Sound quality are exatly the same as pulse. Especially if you upload your preferred sound profile from Pulse for Mode 2.+ Mic quality is exatly the same+ Works 30-40% longer from one charge than Pulse (but i used bassimpact a lot)+ No places for cracks (unlike Pulse)- No bassimpact if you loved it.- No amplification while using 3.5mm cable\n",
      "17966131: Great sound for the price For the price, this is a comfortable and fantastic headset. However, the bass does need to be a little bit louder. Still, fantastic headset and the fact that I can use it for my iPod/3DS as well as plug n' play for my PC, PS3 AND PS4 - definitely worth the purchase.\n",
      "31563196: Good choice I wanted a good wireless headset to play pc comfortably from my couch.They are very comfortable on my head and my friends say it picks up very little to no background noise. A huge improvement over my old Logitechs.The mic is integrated into the left headset, which at first I thought was going to be a downfall, but it has been a blessing.  Now when I eat, drink, and chew like an animal, the mic does not get in the way and it's also not picking up these sounds. The mic has also been great at not picking up when my heavy breathing intensifies.\n",
      "50158130: Golds vs Elites The elites live up to their name tag and definitely sound like the premier sony headset. I also have the sony gold headset and the elites have a higher fidelity sound. The golds are more comfortable and the buttons are much easier to operate while wearing the headset. The elites on the other hand are much harder to operate because of the lower profile buttons. The elites seem more fragile than the golds and I have a feeling the golds will last longer. I have also seen reviews from users experiencing premature failure of the elite headset because of stress cracks at the ear cups. This has not happened to me yet but I have only had the headsets for a week. The elites have the bass impact feature which pulsates the ear cups in a attempt to make the gaming experience more immersive. I found the feature to be annoying and chose not to use it. The golds do not have the bass impact feature so this could be a deal breaker for some who want that added feature. Battery life seems better on the golds compared to the elites but I would suspect that this might be do to the elites superior electronic components. Overall I prefer the gold headset because of comfort and ease of use.\n",

You must not miss The new PlayStation 4 headphones worn close to the ear but will not produce excessive pressure, at the top of the head supporting pad thick soft well share the weight of the earphone. In the game for a long time after wearing and will not produce pain, only natural rest can alleviate fatigue.As an entry-level headphones can provide sound performance can be.

With PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 headphones, increase the equalizer mode game mode or custom to the headset, and better atmosphere levels shown.

Therefore, game player for the reasonable school sound equalizer adjustment is one of the important conditions of the headphones sound performance.\n",

      "19891904: Good for gaming Great headset,  loud enough but I wish it can go louder. It is very loud when playing games, very immersing.  Its stronger and more durable than I thought,  upon research, everyone said how cheap they feel and if you drop them they can break.  I dont know what kind of titanium headphones they are use to but these feel like good quality.  Good headset, comfortable on the ears, worth the money. I gave it 4 because although the volume is loud it cant be deafening loud. Gaming is fine but I like to blast music sometimes and you cant with these. For gaming the headset is good.  To use as a regular pair of headphones is a no no.\n",

      "2715545: Great headset, Great price I've been using these for a couple of months now. I use them on the PS4 and also on my PC for music. My most recent headphones are the monster turbine in-ear headphones. So keep that in mind, I'm not someone who is use to the junk headphones that come with your i-Pod/i-Phone. I got these because I don't like the headphone cord sticking out of the jack on the bottom of the controller. I think the sound quality of this headset is great, I definitely don't have a single complaint about it.  The quick review is that I really like these headphones, I highly recommended them. You get high quality sound, good bass, wireless connection via USB, they are easy to use and for $100, these are absolutely sweet. I think it'd be hard to beat at that price. I use them whenever I can. I mainly purchased these because they are wireless and my girlfriend doesn't like to be woken up by late night gaming ;) I'll hit some topics in greater detail below. I enjoy the headphones enough to at least address the complaints I've read before and after purchasing them.  I've read people complaining about there not being enough bass with these. There's nothing wrong with the bass in my opinion. I was actually surprised at the amount of bass after I had read the complaints about it before ordering. These days I listen to mostly EDM, dub-step, techno, anything electronic really. I'm very happy with the sound. Now it should also be said that it's not crazy brain shaking, overpowering bass but it's enough. Definitely enough for gaming. I think I'm most impressed with the fact that I have yet to hear that static/crackling/distortion that sometimes follows bass sounds in poor quality headphones. These always sound clear, even at high volumes.  Now people may be experiencing problems with bass in games, not music. It never bothered me but I did find out pretty recently that I was using the PS4 app incorrectly. There are EQs that you can set to increase bass sounds and what not. You have to plug the headphones into the USB and upload the profile for it to work. I didn't know that before and was just selecting what I wanted without plugging it in. I'm not sure if I missed that somewhere or if it just wasn't in the instructions. After reading reviews, I'm obviously not the only one who has done this. Now that I've used the app correctly, there is a difference between the EQs when used. It was good before in my opinion but in-game bass improved after the app was correctly used. The music was good without it and I'm actually not sure if the app even applies when using them with other devices besides the PS4. Also you can only select one EQ at a time. Oh well, not a big deal to me. **Edit** The EQ profile that you download from the PS app does continue to work when using the headphones with other devices. In other words, the EQ setting is saved directly on the headphones and works in all situations. ****  There isn't any sound leakage that can be heard by others that is worth complaining about. I asked my girlfriend about it and she can hear the occasional explosion while sitting next to me but nothing major. I expect some leakage with these types of headphones. I definitely can't hear sounds outside of what is playing in the headset, I'm certain on that. Don't plan on having a conversation with others in the room while gaming with these on.  Low volume is another complaint that I can remember reading. I don't think these people have normal hearing. I think the headset gets loud enough for sure. In fact, I often do not have them turned up all the way, explosions are uncomfortable to me at high volumes. I like to play games and music pretty loud, so don't get me wrong. I just have a limit on how loud. I recommend you don't worry about this, these absolutely get loud enough.  I can't comment on the mic. It works, I can hear others clearly, easy to turn on/off and that's all I can say about it. To be honest, I never chat in games. I've found that 90% of the people talking are either annoying or racist and they end up muted lol  **EDIT** I used these headphones with Google+ video chat for 3 months and the mic worked great. Never had a problem with it. You can also adjust the game volume versus the chat volume via buttons on the headset. ****  The surround sound is cool but don't expect to be able to hear EXACTLY where other players are. This is coming from playing COD and Killzone. I read someone saying he could tell exactly where people were from all angles, high and low, with pinpoint accuracy.  He wrote as if he could turn around and shoot the guy pretty much based on sound. This wasn't true for me. I can tell people are close, I can hear them walking from all sides and have a generally good idea of my surroundings. Just don't expect to be able to pinpoint the bad guys with game changing accuracy. Maybe this is a personal issue of mine but I'm happy with the virtual surround sound either way. It's better than normal headphones in this respect. Assassins Creed sounds GREAT and I was very pleased while playing Metal Gear today. Thunderstorms sound awesome in these games. Most people will be satisfied, I know I am.  These are also super easy to use. Literally plug the USB into the PS4 and turn on the headset. The sound turns off on the TV automatically and you're good to go. I have a windows 7 laptop that is a few years old and using the headset on that was just as easy. Plug it in and the drivers install automatically the first time you use it. It really couldn't be easier in my experience. I guess one thing that does suck is that the USB isn't one of those short/micro USB plugs. It sticks out a bit from the front of the PS4. No more than a USB flash-drive does however. And sure, Sony should have added Bluetooth to these but that definitely would have increased the price. I prefer the cheaper price in return for the eyesore. The real question is why isn't the USB a micro one? Not a big deal. It also has an AUX cord connection for whenthe USB can't be used, like in your phone. I haven't tried that so I have no idea if it sounds different or not.  I haven't experienced a problem with the range of the device or its connectivity. I can walk into the next room and hear music/games still. I haven't really tested exactly how far I can get but I didn't buy these so that I could walk all over the house with them. I can use it around my apartment but it isn't a big place by any means. You shouldn't have a problem, for sure, while gaming in front of the TV. The only time I've ever lost connection was when the battery died. Can't complain!  **Edit** As far as connection range goes, don't expect to have a stable connection in a different room. The connection has never dropped on me while in the same room as my PS4. However, it will start to lose its connection when you enter a different room. I've learned this after using them at a few different locations. ****  Battery life last long enough, it gets at least most of the 8 hours that are advertised. Just don't forget to plug it back in after you're done! I've had to use it while charging a few times and it worked like usual out of a USB wall charger. Nothing special about the wall charger, just the USB charger I use with my phone. It does not come with one of these and the USB cord that does come with it couldn't be much shorter. The USB port in the headphones is also the same size as the port in the PS controller. So cords that charge your controller will also charge the headset.  Comfort and size isn't a problem for me. Most people will be very satisfied. I have worn them for hours without feeling uncomfortable or warm. I also believe people that complain about the button layout are being a little ridiculous. I'll admit that I had to take them off a few times to find what I was looking for but just like anything new, you'll learn where everything is located.  **EDIT** Also, I should mention that I now own 2 of these headsets. You can work both headsets atthe same time on a single ps4. It's easy to set up. After powering on the headphones, a log in screen appears and you just select which psn account is going to be using the headphones. Now this allows you to play games and share the audio between two different headsets. Again, both players will hear the same audio. Don't expect to play split screen and receive split audio. You can also watch movies and listen to music this way. Now if you want to chat with your friend wearing the second headset, you will have to create a psn party. That usually works well but you will hear yourself talking if you are sitting too close to your friend with the other headset. *****   Well that was a long review but feel free to ask me questions, I'll respond.\n",

      "38009875: LOVE this headset I've tried a lot of headphones over time, and these are by far my favorite. The #1 thing for me is how adjustable and comfortable they are. I have a fairly large head, to the point that most headphones won't even fit because they don't extend far enough... there will be too much tension and they pull up on my ears. This Sony Wireless Stereo Headset extends plenty far with about 2 notches to spare... and there is little to no tension at all on my head, making them extremely comfortable even for long sessions.I also love how simple they are to use, and multi-platform. Most headsets, especially multi-platform ones, have some complicated setup with 8 wires going all over the place and connecting to adapters, plugging into the back of your TV, using extensions or Y-splitters, etc. None of that here... it has a USB dongle, that's it. Wanna use on PC? Plug in the USB dongle. Wanna use on Mac? Plug in the USB dongle. Wanna use on PS3 or PS4? Plug in the USB dongle. Any questions? Nope.This isn't to mention the fact that they're WIRELESS and only cost a hundred bucks? Are you kidding me?!The sound is excellent. It may not compare to a $300 - $400 dollar headset if you're an audiophile, but I'm not and I personally can't tell the difference. I put them on my wife and turned on a music track, and she immediately just went &#34;Wow, these are amazing.&#34;The only minor gripe I have with this headset is that the battery life isn't stellar. I haven't measured it, but I'd guesstimate I'm getting around 4 hours of continuous use on a charge. Not terrible, but if you have a long game play session they're gonna go dead... and since the charging cable is only about 6 inches long it isn't practical to charge them while using (but on PS4 you can plug them into the controller which will power them, but you lose the 7.1 capability because that's just a stereo output). So you just want to make sure to always plug them back in after each useto ensure you're starting with a full charge each time.TL;DR - Awesome. Big enough for fat heads, super-simple connection on all platforms, WIRELESS, only $100, excellent sound, slightly low battery life.\n",
      "3069724: Great headset for a great price One of the best headsets I've ever used, plain and simple. For the $100 price tag, its one heck of a steal. Highly recommend it, works really well wirelessly with my PS3, PS4 and laptop, aswell as wired to my Phone and Vita.\n",

Not only the 7.1 surround makes the games sound amazing, but also makes it so ONLY I can hear it, and not my roommates. Also in my past(Used to be a professional gamer) I have tried numerous headsets. This headset byfar is one of the best I have ever worn.

I don't own a PlayStation, so I use these headsets to listen to music and talk on Skype on the PC via the USB dongle. The mic is crystal clear! It picks up virtually no background sound, so when you have a naturally loud family like mine who loves to be obnoxious just when you're on a call, this mic is the bro and helps you out. The sound is perfect, and the bass is epic. I play primarily Rap music and the bass is on point and the headset overall is very loud. 1,000% recommend!\n",

I was skeptical at first and saw many &#34;flaws&#34; from review videos online, but since I'm no &#34;Audiophile&#34; and I have been using just standard stereo headphones all my life, this is a big improvement and worth the investment. Highly recommended for the price and quality. The best feeling is the fact it works with all my Playstation devices (PS3/PS4/Vita(wired)) flawlessly.\n",
      "3202884: Very good purchase! Thanks for delivery and the price, in my party they expensive. Excellent quality, compactness, operation of the accumulator, connection.Not many weak bass.I advise to buy!\n",
      "13887901: Good for the price, but some concerns For $99, it's a decent headset.  It's fairly comfortable to wear for extended time frames, and battery life seems to be good.The sound quality is above average.  My only complaint here is lower frequencies sound somewhat distorted and/or clipped. The overall volume is excellent though, and you definitely get a good sense of &#34;surround sound&#34;.  With games such as Call of Duty: Ghosts, you are able to detect the direction footsteps are coming from.The &#34;app&#34; that you can download to your PS4 is pretty lame though.  It's essentially a 3-band equalizer.  There a few presets that you can choose from to download to the headset, but only one preset can be downloaded at a time.  What is sort of aggravating is that you have to connect the headset to the PS4 via a USB cable to download any changes.My biggest complaint is the same as a few others.  The audio literally drops out for 2 to 3 seconds periodically.  It happens relatively often, about every 20-30 minutes.  I've ensured that the headset has direct line-of-site to the dongle plugged in to the PS4.  Hopefully this will be corrected with a firmware update.One other complaint is that when using the headset with other devices (such as a cell phone or Vita) using the included 3.5mm adapter cable, none of the buttons on the headset operate.  For example, you cannot mute the microphone, or adjust the volume on the headset.  The only way to do either is using whatever functions the device your plugged in to may have.Overall, the headset is good, but the audio drop outs are annoying.  I will likely continue searching for a better headset.\n",
      "47094131: Awesome headset! Highly suggested! Just picked this up from bestbuy a few days ago.  And so far, I'm loving everything about them.Super easy to use, wireless is a plus, sound is great, mic is great, sound profiles on ps4, Great battery!  What more could i ask for.A headset is a must for me, because I'm always playing games when my roommates are around.  Sometimes we play games together, and I don't need a mic, but whenever I'm playing a single player game and I want to actually hear whats going on, these are a must!\n",
      "46822975: Slightly disappointing considering the other reviews Bought these since they seemed to be one of the few PS4 compatible offerings on the market right now. Unfortunately they lack a pretty important ingredient when it comes to gaming, noise cancellation. It might be that I've not played around with them enough but when I was using them I found it difficult to focus on the footsteps of my opponent without hearing the people in the office with me speaking and walking around. I normally play with a set of Bose on which is maybe why it was particularly bad for me but I'll still give them 4 stars for the price point. They are reasonable in every other sense for such a low price.\n",

      "11210628: Must Buy This is an awesome headset for its price. Don't pay attention to those who are saying it doesn't come close to their headset that cost double or triple the price, of course it's not going to come close to those. If you want a great headset that is not going to hurt your wallet then get this one.\n",
      "46702329: No bluetooth but decent sound quality For some reason I thought this headset had Bluetooth. You have to use a cable to connect to iphone or other devices. You only can use it wireless on PC, Mac our PS.It has a decent sound, nothing amazing but good.\n",
      "22283630: great headphones for the price Wish it had more bass, but that's really my only complaint. I love these. Before I had some turtle beach p11s with the surround sound box for my ps3 (wired) they where good but these are much better. Battery life is good too they have never died on me, but then again if you play for more than 8 hours maybe you should go outside and kick a ball around\n",
      "23284601: excellent headset Excellent quality, sound, and batery life a good choice for a fair price the best headset you will find for ps4 today\n",
      "25322528: Perfect for 100 Excellent comfort and noise cancellation. Variety of volume settings and way to change the bass boost mode 2 with companion app. Doesn't have bass impact though like the Pulse Elite.\n",
      "13215963: Great sounding but cheap I was really excited about these as I wanted to experience my games and movies while not bothering others around me.  I think that is the best feature.  Waking up and watching some Amazon Prime without disturbing my partner.  The material feels slightly cheap compared to the PS3 model.  They are comfy.  Hold a charge for about a week with 2-5 hours of gameplay at a time.  They also work without being charged by plugging directly into the controller.\n",
      "32074427: Some minor issues, overall a great inexpensive set. **UPDATED** After giving these a good few weeks of playing several titles on the PS4 (Battlefield 4, Resogun, Outlast, Dead Nation, to name a few), I absolutely have enjoyed this set.  Notably in BF4 where I could hear more of my surroundings than I could before, specifically the direction of threats and gunfire.  The chat is clear, and I have had no complaints from others when I speak, even at just above a whisper when my family is sleeping, also note there is no boom microphone, I couldn't tell you where the mic input is by looking at it.  Adjusting between the powerful sound and ability to hear chat clearly takes some trial and error to get to a preferable level.  Otherwise, if you have no one to chat with, crank the sound, it's very satisfying to hear and feel the booms.  Be careful though, I really cranked these bad boys on day one, I am pretty sure I couldn't hear clearly for a solid few hours, they are powerful.The included 3.5mm cable can directly connect to your PS4 controller as well, so you won't burn through the battery as quickly, but in turn, you will lose the virtual surround sound.  Otherwise, the battery life is well beyond what I expected, I played numerous games over the course of 3-4 hours, and only one bar had depleted according to the pop-up menu when pressing the PS button.  Before initial use, I would recommend allowing the set to charge completely before use (about 3 and a half hours).The included USB charging cable is short, very short, not really viable to play and charge at the same time, but an aftermarket cable can fix that pretty easily.The buttons allow a lot of flexibility as well, adjusting chat vs. sound volume, an option to turn VSS (Virtual Surround Sound) off and on at the touch of a button, a minor gripe with this is that there is no determining feature to locate the buttons by touch, after some use, you will commit them to memory pretty easy.  The simplest way to differentiate them is they are all on the left ear cup the chat/game audio adjustment is on the front, volume control in the back, VSS and the selector switch is around the bottom.  A toggle switch allows you to have two separate sound settings programmed directly onto the set, you can have one setup for an FPS game, and the other set for movies, music, etc.  Which is nice to change on the fly.  Additionally, there is an app you can download from the PS store that allows you to utilize pre-programmed settings for different types of media and uploads them to your set, be aware that the upload feature only works when plugged in with a USB cable. To add to the positives, you can also fine-tune the sound to your liking manually as well with adjustment sliders inside the app.As bulky and heavy as they look, I was shocked at how lightweight and comfortable they are.  I don't consider myself to have large ears, but I can feel the inside of the cups on the top of my ear, but it has never become annoying or painful, so no personal complaints here.  Also nice is the matte finish, unless your hands are disturbingly greasy or dirty, you won't be leaving grimey prints on these very easily. The ear-cups also adjust to height as any standard headset will.  It is worth mentioning that outside the set, there are two panels where you see the Triangle, Circle, X, and Square symbols are easily removable, whether we see custom panels for these in the future, or the implication is that you can customize them yourself is beyond me, it's a small, but nice cosmetic feature.  I could see myself maybe throwing a FoxHound sticker on them, as I am a Metal Gear geek. (Can't wait for Ground Zeroes/The Phantom Pain!)With all the good, there is a couple of minor complaints.  The sound transmission seems to periodically become interfered with, or drops out.  I can't tell where the issue stems from, but sometimes I will have distorted, broken, or scratchy audio.  I know that it isn't a distance issue, as I am typically within 5-10 feet from my console at any given time.  I thought at first this was purely an issue with Battlefield 4 (given the problems the game has had, it wouldn't have surprised me), but it happened with other titles.  This rarely happens, and is a minor annoyance at worst.  Another minor complaint is the USB dongle that is required to use with your PS4, you only have two ports as it is, and if you plan to use the headset regularly, you are now down to one.  This is still minor unless you rely on the other port to charge your controller.Overall, this is a great set, and it is difficult to find a VSS headset for the price range.  If you're budget conscious like I am, and can only afford to splurge on a new toy periodically or you just want something to keep noise down for roommates and/or family, you can't go wrong with something that has the Playstation stamp of approval.**UPDATE**: a couple days ago, this set just hit a mont old, there is an aluminum rod that allows free movement to compact into a more storable form factor.  I am not rough on this set at all, but the plastic guide on the right earcup has broken.  KEEP YOUR RECEIPT!!!\n",
      "35330152: Better than expected. This headset is a good improvement to the PlayStation 3 version. It's nicely designed, smooth, flexible, lighter, comfortable and the buttons are nicely placed for quick and easy access. Another plus is that it works on my Mac and PlayStation 3 as well. I really love how you can program the type of sound layout you want on the PlayStation 4. Also, if the battery dies, you can plug it in directly to your PlayStation 4 controller and use it that way. It can also be used as a set of headphones for any device that plays back media. I would recommend it to anyone. You can't beat this quality for the price. People pay over $100 dollars for Turtle Beach or other crappy wired headphones. This headset is wireless and the voice quality is clear with no static.  What more can you ask for? Great job Sony on another great product.\n",
      "3080900: Not what was expected Not what was expected.. If you like loud things then I recommend it but if you prefer quality then this isn't what you are looking for\n",
      "41731443: Good but not great. Expecting more. The sound is ok. Not as great as I was expecting and the noise cancelation sucks I can hear everything around me if the sounds not all the way up.. Also if the sound is up and something loud happens in the game it pops and crackles. But I would have to say that it is pretty nice to have full surround sound in your ears in the middle of the night without having to bother anyone,  you can hear quite a bit, and it is nice they are wireless, however I don't find the customizable channel on it to bee that effective.3 out of 5\n",
      "14695408: Better than expected given the price I bought this headset to substitute the XP500 for two reasons:a) The XP500 (turtle beach) has WiFi interference that makes the signal to drop. I couldn´t fix the problem trying several tips. Really annoying defect.b) Everytime I want to use this headset, I have to switch to optical cable and then switch back to hdmi when I want to go back Receiver.The things I like about the Gold Wireless Stereo Headset:a) No interference with nothing so far.b) You can switch to headset from receiver anytime just by switching it on. Easy as that.c) Feels light and confortable for longer usage.Things to considers:a) Charge for 4 hours before using it.b) Download the Compain App before using it. NOTE: to upload son preset, you should conect the headset through USB to the PS. To get a notorius improvement in audio you should update the headset.c) Don't forget to switch it off after using.Thing you may dislike:a) The sound quality is good (not great, nor outstanding. When compared to Turtle Beach and Tritton, the sound of Gold Wireless Stereo is average. Tritton has true dolby digital sorround with independent speakers.b) Only works as intended with PS3 and PS4.However, the price offset by far those dislike things.If you have a PS4 or/and PS3 and really recommend to buy it. I have a good Home Theater in my bedroom, therefore many times I can not use it because of the noice (especially when my wife and baby sleep). So this headset is a great solution.\n",
      "42232227: Gold wireless headset ps4 Great sound at a small price. Worth every cent even with shipping to Australia. I don't think you'll find a cheaper wireless headset.\n",
      "44676422: For the price...Amazing I've been using them for about a month now, and they're wonderful. There might be better sounding headphones, but nothing in this price range, with these features. The battery life is solid, they say 8 hours, I haven't used them that long in one sitting yet, but I've never had to charge them while playing either, so it's at least 5 plus hours. The microphone quality is great (according to my friends on the other end). It's incredibly easy to adjust chat vs game volume, they're comfortable, light weight, and set up was a breeze (literally just plug them in). Heavy bass effects don't always sound the best, but that would be my only complaint.Overall, I think they're a tremendous value and would highly recommend them.\n",
      "10952115: Good Great headphones only problem is when I'm in a party my friends here my voice really low when it's wireless and then I have to connect the cable for them to here me normally but then the sound only comes out of one earbud.... I'm sure they will patch this or hope they do other than that it sounds great\n",
      "5772001: SuperHeadset for PS4 All the best Amazing!!! Thanx for all!!! Super headset!!! I love ps4 & Gold headset. My recommendation.Sony is a great headst anywere\n",
      "43749923: Great product! The sound quality is very good. I have tested in a lot of games, I will preciate if Sony brings up more profiles. So far the battery life time is also a huge ++\n",
      "49543371: Light and comfortable for your head. This is much better and more comfortable than the Elite. Very light when you are wearing it and does not give you a headache. Much better too when you are wearing glasses. Sound quality is great, same as the Elite. A little cheaper than the Elite since the materials used are mostly plastic. I still love my Elite but I think I'll use this one for playing games long term and watching movies. I ordered this just in time because when I checked it out again it is sold out on here. Now other sellers are selling this way too much than the original price of $99.99. Bravo Sony!\n",
      "42290248: Using with a PS3- awesome sound (after adjustments) I have some wired Turtle Beach phones and was getting really tired of the bulky long cable getting in the way. I was a little worried about using wireless phones as far as sound quality goes, but these sound great and are well worth the price.If you use this on a PS3, make sure you do the following after plugging them in:-switch phones to '2'.-by default, they sound like tinny garbage.-download the headset companion app from the play store.-To 'upload' an audio profile you MUST PLUG THESE IN VIA THE USB CHARGING CABLE. This was not in the instructions.-launch the app and upload one of the game profiles to the headphones (I selected FPS)-now you can unplug the USB cable and the audio quality should dramatically improve.Pros:WirelessSound greatDecent priceComfyCons:Companion app setup/UINot very comfortable sitting around your neckSo long cables!\n",
      "39368515: Good for the price. Pretty good headphones for the price. Comfy and sound good. The ability to use them with Vita, PC etc is a plus.\n",
      "3116131: Good It works great, love it. It is not expensive but high quality. If you are looking for a headset to pair your lovely PS3 or PS4, this is a good choice\n",
      "50358417: Kickass Headset for $100 bucks So i was in the market for a new pair of headset as i got tired of my previous headset(Turtle Beach Z11's), i didn't want cheap sounding headsets so i knew i was gonna hafta pay more for better sound quality. I had a hard time choosing between Astro A40s($249.99) Turtle beach PX4(129.99) and the Sony Gold Wireless Stereo headset(99.99). After doing my research i decided to opt for the Sony Gold Wireless headset and i hafta to say best 100 bucks spent. The sound quality is just simply amazing when i was gaming and listening to music. While gaming i could hear every word that was said clearly,every footstep taken, guns blazing, and explosions. When i was listening to music the bass was just incredible i thought i was gonna go deaf after awhile. This headset is compatible with PS3 PS4, PS Vita PC and Mac, mobile devices work as well with the 3.5mm jack. Battery life on these headset are pretty decent if you don't have them at full blast and you also get a nice carrying pouch if your on the go. I mostly brought these headset for my PC and i'll prolly buy another pair when i purchase my PS4 in the future but i can say i recommend these headset to anyone.\n",
      "42273547: Perfect This product works really well and only use internal power when bluetoothing. I use it when I go to work when I am at work and when I get home best headphones I have ever owned.\n",
      "41924223: Great Cheap Headphones loud, you can tell when enemies are walking very well (on call of duty), and they are mostly comfortable.  If you wear them for a while, your ears starts to hurt (5+ hours without taking them off) other than that I really have no complaints for these.If you want to start gaming, and need headphones I would recommend you buying these.\n",
      "17097254: Sold price for a solid headset Sound that pumps out of these headphones is great. The headband does feel a little cheap and overly plastic; feel like I could snap it in half with out too much effort. The hidden microphone makes the headset look really sleak. Over all, a great headset at a price that's hard to beat.\n",
      "20802381: Great sound, wireless, and works on my PC wireless too! [[VIDEOID:moLPC8WRXXWIC4]]When I saw this wireless headset, I just had to get it!  I was looking for a wireless headset to use with my PS4 that sounded awesome and this fit the bill.  Also the price was really reasonable too.  Now let me go over the pros and cons of this headset.Pros:* 7.1 Surround sound when used with a PS4* Great sound quality when used on a PS4, PS3, or PC - I like the richness of sound that these headsets deliver(I tested on a WIN7 Ultimate PC)* Works on a PC* Portable and comes with a cloth carrying case* Auxiliary cable to use on any other device (use if only if nothing else is available)* Headset Companion App - Able to modify audio profiles and use it on 2 modes (switch on headset)Cons:* Auxiliary cable - Although also a pro, it's a minor con as well because the sound is just not up to par with other headsets and sounds really cheap.  Of course I would think that you would use it mainly for the PS4 anyway.  It does sound good on a PC too.* Charging micro USB is a little short, but you could use any Micro USB to charge itPrior to this I was using a [[ASIN:B00B1KJK22 Plantronics GameCom 780 Surround Sound Stereo PC Gaming Headset]] and although it worked, none of the controls worked on the actual headset so you would have to manually go back into the system to change the volume, mute, etc.Overall I think this is a really great sounding headset that is wireless (PS3, PS4, PC).  Although the sound quality is lacking when the audio cable is used, at least it gives you that option if you need it.  You can also download the Headset Companion App to change the audio profiles to your liking, but the sound quality out of the box is great as well.  Get this headset!\n",
      "10720796: Okay headphones There was a lot of hype around this product. I got suckered into it right away, like I do with everything. I bought it for two reasons. It was cheap and it promised surround sound in/on your ears. I am an audiophile. Sound is more important to me than lyrics. So getting a rich, well balanced, and comfortable headphones was a priority. After dishing out 560 on PS4 and games, i was under a tight budget and needed something of quality while not breaking my pocket.So now that you know my motivations, you may reserve the judgement to yourself and read on.Sound: since this is the most important aspect of headphones, i will start there. There are two settings on left headphone. First one is well balanced. Second two is bass heavy. It is not true surround. You will notice stereo distribution of sound but unfortunely, the sound is 2D and does not give a since of sound coming from different locations on x,y,z. I am of course comparing this to BOSE, which not only has a well balanced stereo while also rich 3D feel to it. It is the difference between being in a concert versus listening to a recorded version of the concert. That being said, I noticed that headphones sounded better with ps4 and ps3 than PC or Mac. If you are a Bass lover, Beats is your better option. There are no screaching or static sounds heard. Sound is clear but lacks a wow factor. You will not get the goose bumps like you do with BOSE.Construct: i am not going to sugar coat this, it feels plasticky. You know how you see a girl from far and she is well dressed and carries herself well and positive energy immenates from her. And you think to yourself, &#34;Wow, she is so hot.&#34; Then you get with in a meter of her and realize, she has five different layers of foundation and systematically distributed shades of makeup to give her face a symmetric appearance. Guys, I think you know what I am talking about and girls, I love you all equally with or without makeup. That is theonly way to describe this product. It fits well. Adjustable. Not heavy. Confortable on the head. The ear pads are soft. They are supposed to encompass your ears but my ears are either to large or the ear pads are just a bit smaller for my liking. 5x7 cm ear size. It has a simplistic look.It says I am average headphones with modest looks, leaning on cool looks with no inclination of geekiness.\n",
      "7929580: Must have! Amazing!! Simple just plug and play. Sound quality is awesome.  I have nothing bad to report. The battery life is good and all.\n",
      "11312985: Awesome headset! I've own the Sony Pulse Elites, Trittons, and the Original Sony headset and this by far is the best. Battery life is excellent and the build is great. Comes with microfiber carrying bag, usb, and a 3.5 cable that you can plug into your ps4 controller. I highly recommend getting this headset and for the price you can't beat it. Better then the highly priced headsets.\n",
      "13254218: Amazing for the prize Bought these about a month ago and so far they are amazing. I have used them on my PS4, PS3 and my PC. The sound quality is top notch in my opinion. The build quality so far is holding up quite nicely as well.They fold up and fit into an included tote bag which is a nice touch for carrying them around places. I have no issues with the dongle and for me they worked wonderful out of the box. PS4 includes a companion app (for free) to help adjust the sound profiles and create custom profiles as well. The bass on the headset is very nice and everything I have listened to (games, music, netflix etc) sounds great. Used them for skype as well and no issues with the mic or being able to be heard.I'm considering buying a 2nd pair just so I dont have to carry them from my living room to my bedroom at night, wonderful headset.\n",
      "15405974: Perfect choice for PS4 This one is perfect..Comfortable, nice sound quality, good price...Dont think, just order it..You can not buy a better headset for this price...You will not regret\n",
      "10920080: Great headset Before I purchased these I didn't know what all the hype was with gaming headsets. I thought they were a waste of money and weren't needed at all for gaming. I was wrong! This headset is awesome and if you play games like COD and battlefield they are a must. I can hear everything with these things. I can point out the exact direction some one is coming from because the surround sound is so crisp and clear. For 100 these are a steal. You won't find a better headset for the price.\n",
      "25132671: Perfect gift These head phone were a Perfect valentines day gift for my gamer, he says they work great. I would recommend to others\n",
      "23017346: Get it. The headset is wonderful. It has amazing build quality, and audio fidelity. It has a pretty good battery life, and it works with your PC as well.  It also has a handy little silky pouch to carry it in if you take it somewhere. Also, it is super comfortable. You almost forget it is there.\n",
      "19528692: Buy it now Best sony headset ever made..good build quality ...so comfortable ...and isnt heavy at all .....so cheap...it should be priced more than 100$\n",
      "29083045: what awesome If you have a PlayStation three PlayStation for PS Vita I highly recommend these headphones they are truly amazing with a 7.1 surround sound get them.\n",
      "52621203: Great!!! Just a really good headset. Can use it with PC, ps4, ps3, vita, and your phone. You can't beat it for a 100 bucks. Battlefield 4 sounds so good and the guns sound amazing with these. Another great product from Sony.\n",
      "42084097: Comfortable and top headset audio quality Pros:The new headset is very lightweight and comfortable even wearing for a long time (2-3 hrs w/o any problem for me).The folding design is great and with the nice bag included in the package the headset is easily portable.Audio quality is good with EQ controls in headset app, though the Virtual Surrounding Sound doesn't boost the experience so much it does feel different.Cons:I'm personally not quite a fan for the new design. Lack of some &#34;tech&#34; feels when you're looking at the plastic and rubber.Battery sometimes dropped down too fast (fully charged, played for 1-2 hours and switched off, but after 24 hrs when I pick it up again the battery is low). I believe there're some bugs that causing this. However for the rest of the time the battery works great - at least much much much better than the Dualshock 4.Must use cables for connecting to systems other than PlayStation 3/4, bluetooth is not compatible for them.Sorry for my English. :)\n",
      "28138787: Not bad Messed around with it for a few hours, and it is a good product.  Its a solid headset.  Gaming and music sound good.\n",
      "16560054: Love them Just picked these up today from my local target store for $99.99 I own a pair of wireless beats by DRE. Payed $279.99, and these gold headset by play station are totally worth every penny I would honestly say I like them more than my beats there more comfortable, sound quality about the same, lighter than the beats, the mic is just as clear, though the beats work off Bluetooth and the gold headset works off a USB receiver I still like them a lot more just my personal opinion. For a hundred dollars you can't go wrong. So if your debating on wether to get them you won't be disappointed game on gamers.\n",
      "47956883: Meh I think sony is getting kinda money hungry. These things are horrible,  i would rather use my beats with a build in mic.\n",
      "14249702: unbeatable for the PRICE I've owned these for almost two weeks and love them…  I have the Turtle Beach Px51, which I love but they've had a compatibility issue with the PS4 (they sound works fine, but not the mic) Out of the box, these headsets were a bit high in the treble but I just turned off the default effect and they sounded much better.  For $100, you can't go wrong with these!\n",
      "2970414: The best headset I've ever owned, unbeatable for the price I absolutely love this headset. Awesome sound quality, extremely comfortable, an excellent mic, and the wireless options make this worth the buy. I mainly use the headset as headphones and as a headset on my PC, and I couldn't be any happier with them. Holds a very good charge, I was playing DayZ with some friends for a total of 8 hours and battery is still going strong. Only complaint is the USB dongle seems to only work on the PC if plugged directly into the PC and not a hub, though other devices I've owned that require a strong connection had the same issue, so no big deal. Buy this headset, you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "14317550: Comfy, works good, but... Found out after some experimenting...accidentally, to get the mic to work properly U have to have the controls on the LEFT side, otherwise the mic won't pick up UR voice properly!\n",
      "39858095: Definitely Disappointing. So I bought these because I saw plenty of good reviews and I wanted to switch to a wireless set. I currently use the turtle beach ear force sevens, which are wired, and this sony gold headset can't even compare to the turtle beaches I have. If you've never had a gaming headset before, than these will seem great, but if you've ever used a quality headset you'll feel let down. First off, you can't hear yourself talk. I think that's a large flaw in itself. Secondly, there's next to no bass, even when mixed with the companion app. Also, the buttons are limited. Why should I have to choose between chat sound and game sound in one button. It's like I can't have loud chat and game sounds. Only one or the other, or a mix where both are dull. Each should have there own rocker. This headset has limited control. I'm almost ranting cause these were such a disappointment. On the upside, they are extremely easy to use and semi-comfortable so that's where the two stars come from. Just beware, you get what you pay for.\n",
      "18219506: Great headset for the price point. For $99.99 you can't get a better headset....especially one with the 'custom' PS4 integration. I'm looking forward to the developer released, game specific, sound settings to load up into these.A lot of YouTube videos that I have watched have stated that the bass isn't that great. Well, disagree. The bass is clear and concise just are the mids and lows....keep in mind that I do NOT like heavy bass so this set works perfectly for me.My ONLY complaint with this set is that fact I can't really hear myself talk into the microphone like I can with my TurtleBeach PX22s.\n",
      "15204232: Good sound, poor microphone set up This is quite a comfortable head set to wear for long periods. The sound quality is very good and I actually can here somethings better with these on then when using my surround sound system. Such as the sound in Need for Speed Rivals when you activate the JAMMER pursuit tech. I could here it on Surround system but it was easily over looked. With these it brought out the low end sound of it and you are very aware of it. I could set the base on the surround to emphasize it but I don't always want to reset my speakers all the time. The one draw back I find is the mic being built into the side of the ear piece just doesn't pick up what I say unless I am talking quite loud. Yes other people can here me but are forced to turn down there own sound to pick up what I am saying. I know I like it a bit loud when I play, gives you an immersive experience and all, so I don't like making others turn down their sound to accomodate me. what I lie the most about these headsets is they do have surround sound in them. You can here sounds to the left and behind you. So I give it a four and wish I could go five if perhaps it had better mic placement or better sensitivity.\n",
      "6533942: great for price Awesome product! Honestly much sturdier than I had anticipated for the price. Not the absolute best sound quality on the planet compared to other headsets but by far the best for the price!\n",
      "51052302: I am only using this for the PS4 Sound is good, most of the time I forget I'm wearing them and think my 5.1 surround sound system is on.  I like the different sound profiles that can be set using the PS4 app.  Could do without the folding cups IMO, and the battery life is at about six hours at med/low volume.  Good fit for a big head, good sound, easy setup and connection, and chat works well, worth the price for wireless.\n",
      "39301702: Its good, but Update. 04/20/2016 I have purchased 3 of these headsets to avoid moving them from room to room- along with the adapters. All 3 have cracked just above the &#34;fold&#34; point of the headset. some gorilla superglue gel fixed that until a second and then a 3rd crack . Finally ended up fashioning a metal band with the correct curve to hold them together. I like the wireless but overall my old turtle beach ps3 wired headsets with the ps4 adapter are better. I just wish these were better quality. First, let me say I have 8- yes 8 ps3 consoles and one ps4. All connected to their own flat screen TV's. I am retired and I play games ALL day. I have 3 turtle beach usb headsets 3 of the &#34;older&#34; ps3 (sony) wireless versions - the one with the boom microphone and 2 of these new &#34;gold&#34; versions. The sound is better on these for sure. The people I play with - from all around the world- have all said the chat sound is much better on the older version sony headset. also note that with the sony headset the mic level is set to a maximum setting of 3- where other - like the turtle beach- I can set the mic level to 5 on the audio settings in the xmb bar. The other thing that was a little disappointing is the battery life. I fully charged both of these prior to use the first time- and have recharged them several times now and you will get the beeping in your ear telling you the battery is about to die after about 4 hours. Not what the ads say for sure. also- you only get about 3-4 minutes warning that the battery is about to die so pay attention when it beeps. The &#34;older&#34; sony headsets give about 15 minutes warning. usually enough time to finish a level and grab another headset.\n",
      "3245841: Super Simple absolutely PLUG & PLAY. they sound really great too and the chat is clear (according to my friends anyway).  Happy gaming.\n",
      "39464956: Hearing impaired person here - did not suit me. Well, I've been trying to find a headset for my PS4 that won't cause feedback on my hearing aids for awhile now. I think I'm gonna give up hope now :(\n",
      "14184972: I am VERY HAPPY!!!! Update: 8/18/2014    FOR PC USERS!!!!!!!  If you want more sound customizability while using this wirelessly on your PC, I have found a way. RAZER SURROUND!!!! Download the free application from Razer.com and the application not only allows you to customize EQ settings on the fly with the headset, but also gives you virtual surround as well!!!!!! Now you can enjoy the full benefits that you get on consoles, even more in my opinion since Razer surround has more EQ sliders to play with. The only catch is that you have to sign up with Razer so Synapse, their cloud program where the settings are stored, can store our settings and you can use the same settings on other PCs.        Update: 3/3/2014 - I tested the mic by doing a recording and playing online on PC. The quality is very good. There is no background noise that I could hear in the recording and my friend reported hearing none while playing online. Keep in mind this is not a studio mic or super high quality mic, but for the job it is intended to do, it does it well.  I also figure out that you CAN CUSTOMIZE THE EQ SETTINGS FOR PC, but it HAS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE PS3/PS4 COMPANION APP! You need to physically connect the headset to your PS3/PS4 and upload the sound profiles you want or the custom EQ settings. It will be saved to the \\\\\"2\\\\\" switch on the headset. These just keep getting better and better!!!!      First of all, I was looking for an all around great experience on my PS3 AND my PC. From the research that I did on this headset and the various reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere I gathered that this headset was in high quality and sounded great on the PS3 and PS4, especially because they have the virtual 7.1 surround sound for the consoles. Also, from what I've gathered, is that on PC, it sounds great but not as great as it can.    Well, I did some testing and here are my findings.    I compared this headset to the SteelSeries Spectrum 5XB Headset that I also own. Now the steel series had pretty good sound but lacked a little thump to the base, but overall sound quality was top notch with its 40mm drivers. I use an Asus Xonar DG sound card to customize the equalizer settings so I can get the very best sound I possibly can with those headphones.    Now for the Sony Golds:  Using the provided USB wireless dongle, I plugged it in to PC and setup was very easy, just plug and play. Keep in mind that Sony did not write any proprietary drivers for the wireless dongle so Windows will install the GENERIC MICROSOFT DRIVERS for the wireless USB dongle to function with the headset, hence customizability to the sound with an equalizer is impossible unless you program your own drivers or you can find generic custom drivers on the net.    That aside, the sound quality relayed from the dongle is quite good! I played games and listened to music with them and they are very comparable to the steel series headset. I set the switch to the 2 setting, that setting generally gives you more bass and richer sound, granted though that the sound is not all that it could be given that it is running on generic software drivers......luckily, this headset has a built in 3.5mm built in to it. Using the provided 3.5mm cable  that is provided I connected the headset to my front panel jack which is connected to my sound card. I adjusted the equalizer settings in order to get the cleanest bass, good distortion-less thumps, and clear highs.........WOW!!!!! This headset truly shines when you have the ability to customize the equalizer settings! The sound quality is higher than the steelseries. The sound is fuller, richer, highs come through great and lows have good weight to them. Music is AMAZING on them!!!!  As for gaming while connected to the 3.5mm jack....it sounds amazing as well. I played battlefield 4 and these babies bring you every sound crystal clear. The sound even better when I set the card to 7.1 virtual surround sound, set the game to wartapes and set the sound to surround in-game.    Asfor the PS3 performance......simply fantastic! everything sounds great, rich and clear, the 7.1 emulation is very good as well.    I've played for at least 3 hours and they are very comfortable for me.    All in all. BUY THESE!!!! You won't get better for the money!\n",
      "58999: Excellent Headphones Best pair of headphones I own. They sound great and do not consume or require a charge to use them with the head phone jack only wile using it wireless does it consume power. So when using them to listen to music with your phone or play games on the go with the vita one does not need to worry about them being charged. Over all just a very versatile headset that is great for games music and movies. They sound amazing wile playing Battlefield 4 and work great with the ps4 and ps3.Only draw backs i would say is the mic. The audio your friends receive on their end is worse than the mic the ps4 comes with. Not saying the mic quality is bad but it just sounds less clear like a phone call and more like a typical headset. I would explain it like this this headset is the equivalent of calling from a cellphone and the one the ps4 comes with makes you sound like you are calling from a land line.\n",
      "23848865: Great value, Great sound These far exceeded my expectations in every way. A lot of the reviews have said these are great due to the price, but the sound quality isn't the greatest - that is true; however, for what it's intention is - it far exceeds it's low cost. Compare it to any other wireless headset just used for communication and you're looking at $50 for the company's brand (I have the wireless headset for xbox 360, the Halo: Reach edition) which cost me that - and that is all it's good for is simply talking.This provides extremely helpful and amazing surround sound for it's price - I primarily use it for Battlefield 4, which completely immerses you in the gameplay and my 1st reason for getting these, but I have also tried them out on my PC just watching movies and listening to music and stands up audibly to the higher end Skullcandy, while adding the surround sound package ontop of it.I can't recommend these enough for someone that wants a great headset that does more than anything near its price, and only breaking your wallet with half of the intensity of the competition\n",
      "42292507: Satisfied So far so good. Great sound quality for chat and gaming. Easy to use buttons once you figure out the design. I do wish I could not be so loud on the mic or some adjustment...but its okay so far. Comfy.I like the two modes you can customize for your particular gaming sound. Worth the price.\n",
      "48297870: These are really nice for the price Are these the best sounding headphones you'll ever use? No. They're 100 dollar wireless headphones, and for that price they sound fine, but only after significant tweeking. Do not buy these headphones without also downloading the PS4 app for your PS4. If you do, set your headphones to setting #2, connect it to your PS4,  and then go into the app and download one of the modes that adds bass to your setup. Otherwise you're going to hate these things. The default sound setup is absolute garbage. No bass whatsoever, which is probably what people who rated these low heard. If you leave it on setting 1 or never modify the settings for setting 2, you're going to hate these headphones.Also a note about the simulated 7.1 audio. It's awful. Personal opinion, but I much prefer the sound with it off. It also includes a cable to use these with any device like a normal non-wireless set of headphones, and using them this way sounds pretty darned good. Good bass, nice highs. I like it that way a lot too. I'd give these 5 stars, but they're built kinda cheap and also I have no idea why they'd include a default mode that can't be changed that is just awful. Settings 1 and 2 should both be configurable imo.\n",
      "30076619: Great Headset for the Price! for $99.99 you get a very comfortable headset!.... chat and games sound great through this headset!!  definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to pay $$$$ for a headset!\n",
      "32769293: These Headphones are just amazing I bought these headphones as a secondary set of headphones for my PS4 that is in the basement and I didn't expect much for 99 dollars, but I just wanted something decent. First of all the set up is just a piece of cake, even a 5 year old could do it and second the sound is just incredible. My other set I have is the Turtle Beach XP510's and yes they are better than the Sony Gold's but not 200 dollars better no way. If given the choice when I got my XP510's I would have bought the Gold's and saved 200 dollars for sure.I really just can't say enough good things about this headset, and if you are on the fence wondering if you should buy them don't be because you wont be disappointed I promise you. I hear some people complaining that they don't have any bass, that is baloney! I did do download the companion app as soon as I installed them so maybe those people complaining didn't do that and that is the difference, I don't know. That is the only thing that I can figure because when I play call of duty the grenades and explosions sound fantastic. These headphones are easily worth 150-200 dollars! Sony has hit a Home Run here folks!\n",
      "18495619: Great product for $100 Got it shipped to Australia paid about $140 Aud, with express delivery.Great sorround sound, massive upgrade from my regular computer headphones. Enhanced my bf4 experience quite a bit.Just get it.\n",
      "36464134: Great features and sound for the price, bad build quality For $100, it is hard to find a headset that includes all the features of the Gold Wireless headset. Sony obviously cut their costs through build quality. Its not that the headset will fall apart, but it is all plastic and feels very fragile.However, for $100 you can't have it all. Very comfortable even through long use. Definitely recommend this to both PS4 gamers and for use with PC games.\n",
      "31591060: Better than expected, clear sound Product is great for the price, no hard setup, just charge it, plug the transmitter, and done, ready to turn on and play. Also the headset companion app works as designed.I played Bioshock Infinite, The Last of Us on PS3  and AC4 and Killzone shadow fall on PS4, the sound is really, VSS, it helps in games like TLOU to identify where the enemies (clickers, oh I hate those guys) are. battery life great, I played over 5 hours and no need to charge.also the effect provides a deeper experience, since it blocks ok enough sound around you, so with a mild volume, you wont hear anything else than just your game. Buttons are just a matter to learn where they are, a 5min learning curve and then you are set.Overall, I am planning to buy another headset to have one dedicated per system instead of changing the USB receiver from one system to the other.\n",
      "7560200: With the right modifications on the equalizer this is perfect! First of all, I am by no means an expert in the audio field, but I do love listening to music! I come from PX5 which were not really good with music, but did it's job for video games. As for these headphones, they completely blew my expectations out of the water. For a low price of 99$, there isn't much that can match these headphones. I will have to warn people though that at standard settings for both companion and system (PC and Android) its alright, but with some EQ mods these speakers produce amazing sound. Although its not wireless when I use on my phone, the quality does not drop much with the cord (My phone is rooted and utilizes all cores when I mod the audio). Of course, it may not satisfy audiofilics, but for those who just go buy Beats By Dre., these are so much more affordable and have amazing quality. These also dont have the traditional gaming headphones look and can be worn outside. I have used these in the gym for about since they came out and I work out almost everyday. No breakdown or anything like that, and with these speakers, the bass is just amazing.\n",
      "41159214: Totally worth it This headset is really cool, it makes things simpler. I really like the features it has they are absolutely good.\n",
      "45571883: Leaving my XP500 Headset behind for these Having recently switched from XBox 360 to PlayStation 4, I attempted to use my Turtle Beach XP500 headset without much success. While they played the audio, they also played a lot of interference, the pops and cracks that destroy the quality and enjoyment of the audio.From the moment I installed and began using the Gold Wireless headset, I have encountered no audio interference, and the surround sound is excellent!  BF4 is better with the 7.1 surround sound, being able to tell which direction shots and/or helicopters are coming from.Recommend this headset!\n",
      "19544952: Sony GOLD Wireless Headset's Many Issues with the PS4!! There are numerous known issues with the GOLD headset.  The GOLD has a number of serious issues with it's operation on the PS4. See if my Thread can help you.    I've left replies to PS4 players questions,  trying to give them some information and a direct link to my thread discussing the GOLD's issues... but the Sony Moderators have been deleting my replies to Sony customers with the Gold Headset.    I guess posting several replies, on the same day in the Playstation Support Forums, answering Players questions and trying to direct them, to a current GOLD Support Thread to help them with their GOLD Headset issues, is considered SPAMMING by the Moderators.  Oh Well.  Also use the Forum's SEARCH option to find all the threads on the GOLD headset's issues.  It's a shame the Support Moderators in this forum are not helping to answer all the questions from it's SONY Customers.    Look for my post labeled  \\\\\"Sony GOLD Wireless Headset ***WARNING***\\\\\", to see if you can find your answers there.  [...]    I hope this helps you.\n",
      "16021518: Good headset at a good price I've never really found it necessary to wear headsets while playing video games, mostly because they're so expensive. I decided to give the Gold Headset a try because of it's lower price point. I'm glad I made this purchase. The sound quality is good and the headset is very comfortable, even when I wear it for long periods of time. It's also a plus that I can use this headset with any device that has a 3.5mm audio port. So while there are other more expensive headsets out there that have better sound quality, this is a solid headset at a relatively good price.\n",
      "25788641: really good for 99dollars i got this headset last night at gamestop and wow they r really good the sound is good other players can hear me really good the bass is ok not to bad i have the ps3 stereo headset and the gold wireless is way better so if u have 99dollars pick one up they r worth it\n",
      "32969192: Recommended Headset! I'm not an audiophile and the only other headset I have owned was the Tritton 720s, but this headset towers above it. For $99 you couldn't ask for a better headset. It is very comfortable and light. It doesn't feel cheap (as some other reviewers say). Yes there are better headsets out there like the Astro's and such that cost $250+, but for $99 this headset is more than what you're paying for. You can download the PlayStation Companion App and be able to customize your own settings, (raise bass, mids, treble) or you can download customized settings (shooters, action, racing, etc.) straight to your headset via the USB cable. It does come with a foot long charging cable, but you CAN use the PS4 charging cable instead since it is longer. It folds nicely and it fits my big head. It doesn't feel like it'll break as some other headsets do. The mic is hidden and the controls are easy to learn. Overall, very pleased with this purchase.Btw I bought mine at GameStop because I couldn't wait for the shipping here lol.\n",
      "2908520: Great for a 99$! I bought this headset in pre-order. and I waited almost 2 weeks before it arrived to me at last!And after this waiting I have to say that the headset didn't disappoint me thankfully! great sound, great design AND it's so comfortable to wear.I recommend every PS owner to buy one of these and with this amazing prize, I'm sure you'll like it.\n",
      "7845827: Amazing Sound!!!! Despite some negative reviews, for the chat sound, purchased hopeful my son would love it, He Cried!!!!  He walks around with them on all the time, and says that the bad reviews for the chat were wrong! (maybe they got a dud)  Have a pair on the way for me now....cannot wait....he let me use his for about an hour, the sound is amazing for the ps3 game I was playing, (I did not use the chat feature)\n",
      "18379296: Solid Picked these up today and have been giving them a solid run through everything. Hooked up to my PS systems with no issues. Sound is great for a $99 wireless headset. Connected to my PC and music quality is fantastic. Can't go wrong with these for sure.\n",
      "7465454: Hear me good I bought this headset mainly to use it with the playstation. However, lately I have been using it with my iPad and iPhone to listen to music. I'd have to say I am surprised how well they block out the ambient noise and how crispy they sound. While not exactly cheap, the price is not bad for what you get when you compare it to other units.\n",
      "20594274: Better than I expected for the price I've never been crazy about headsets, but this one stood out with features and price. I gave it a shot, and I'm very glad with the results.Pros:7.1 virtual surround sound is truly incredible. As you move, the sound will gradually get louder or softer, and it will transition from one ear to the other if you turn aroundWireless, and it works great. Links up right away and never loses the connectionUses the same charging cord as a PS4 controllerChat/Game volume adjustable (turn down the game volume to hear team mates)3.5mm jack to use on just about any deviceGreat price ($100 price at writing)Very good battery life (after 3 hours it was still showing 2/3 battery levels)Cons:Wireless needs the transmitter on PS3 and PS4 (included, though), taking up a USB portIncluded charging cord is 1ft (BUT, like I said, the PS4 charging cable works too)The headset can also become irritating after a few hours. I'm still new to headsets, so I could just take some getting used to, which is why I didn't include this with the cons.Overall, a terrific product. I'm really glad I got this over some of those other $200+ headsets.\n",
      "23578828: Amazing You cannot go wrong with these.....they are amazing and clear. They fold up and have a storage bag to store them in. They can be used with a computer, PS3 or PS4, and are wireless. I would get these over anything I was researching before.\n",
      "32032127: Great headset This headset has great sound quality. But the problems are that they have no bass. Also, my friends tell me that my mic quality is horrible, but they can still understand. This headset looks really cool and is really comfortable and has a good battery life. You could also download an app from the Playstation Store called the headset companion app and you could customize the sound settings which is very cool. Overall, these headsets are really nice but they have horrible mic quality.\n",
      "31855268: I prefer the PS Gold Headset over the PS Pulse Elite Headset. (I have both as well). Pros1. Better looking than the Pulse Elite imo. Love the blue and black.2. Came with a charging cord. When I brought my PS Pulse Elites, I had to use the same cord that came with the PS3 system that I use to charge my controller (the dualshock 3 that is).3. Came with a carrying bag.4. It's foldable.5. The earcups move to adjust and not the entire sides.6. Removable sides for future customization (haven't seen any custom plates yet though).7. Doesn't clamp on your head as hard as the PS Pulse Elites.8. Cheaper than the PS Pulse Elites (by about 15$ on Amazon I believe).9. Better battery life than the PS Pulse Elites.Neutral1. No base impact. Tbh, I found the rumbling of the PS Pulse Elite to be annoying and always turned it off.2. Has it's own dedicated app with sound modes for game genres and game titles for the PS3 and PS4. (But so does the PS Pulse Elites which can hold up to 5 at a time compare to this headsets 1)3. L and R indicators are inside the cups. Should've been outside.4. Hidden microphone (same as the PS Pulse Elite). I don't use it much.Cons1. Charging cord isn't long at all. Grateful that it's included and I don't have to use the cord that charges my dualshock 4 that came with my ps4, but come on.2. No Bluetooth. I have to use the cord that came with the headset and connect it to itself and the device I want to use in order to listen to audio on my cell phone or Vita (no wireless).\n",
      "21582430: Worth every cent. Pros:Very comfortable, easy setup, great packaging.Alrights: Noise cancelling, max volume and build quality is not as good as the pulse elites but for the price, its really good.Cons: none.I know how build quality matters to a lot of people, but since i don't play football with my headsets, it doesn't bother me.If you are not in a hurry to get a headset,be patient and wait.I am pretty sure they will come up with an elite version or in this case a \\\\\"platinum\\\\\" version. just like last time.Remember to update ps4 to firmware version 1.61 or above for bass impact.\n",
      "17290846: sweet Love these jewels 10x better than the turtle beaches I had for PS3!  Sony makes the best products for their machines...\n",
      "18220490: MY FIRST HEADSET SO NO EXPERIENCE I had always used a regular Bluetooth microphone, gosh I needed a headset before I was born, especially being a hardcore gamer it just completes the experience. Sony competes in any category of electronics and I have a ps3 so I had to get this one. Wish it was completely wireless but that's ok the style and comfort makes up for it plenty, plus I don't think any gaming headset would be comfortable to wear to listen to music while your cooking, mowing the lawn, doing the laundry etc.  If you decide to buy, connect to ps3 with the usb that's included and while its charging download the app for it on the playstation store, you will need to upload the preset equalizer to the headset to improve quality whether it be a shooter game or an action movie you will choose shooter or action accordingly but there are other presets.\n",
      "48251082: PS4 Headset. (Best for price and usage) Got this as a valentines gift and have been in love with it ever since. Set up is simple and for what this headset was designed for (gaming) you can't beat it. Comfortable feel and will last for hours of usage. Works great with Remote Play (PS Vita) as well! Easily the biggest perk for me. As I use Remote play very often and like to have these on while playing.. A must have for any avid PS4 user..\n",
      "36713842: I was prepared to be disapointed but was wrong Fit:I want to start off by saying that my first concern when buying this headset was fit and comfort.  I have a big head 7 3/4in hat size.  I have to say that these fit my head perfectly!  No squeeze whatsoever.  The cans completely covered my ear and sealed nicely.  They are lightweight and the padding in the headband is super comfortable.  Wore these for 2-3 hours straight with no discomfort.Sound:Sound is great.  Crisp and clean.  I've seen some complaints about these not being loud enough or not blocking out noise from outside sources.  They do a great job of both.  I consistently have to take them off when any one tries to speak to me with them set at a medium volume level.  The 7.1 surround sound does a good job.  Better than I expected for a $100 headset.  The bass is about the only thing that I see most people will have a problem with this headset.  The base is not horrible by no means but it won't cause your brain to shake in your skull either.  Which was not a problem for me.Price:Great value.  Can't beat this price for a good headset.Construction:I've heard people say these feel cheap or flimsy.  I didn't really feel that way.  Honestly, when I held them it reminds of controller.  They fell like they are made of the same material.  They feel like they will hold up to long term use as long as they are treated with respect.Overall these are well worth what I paid for them.  Very pleased.  Great fit, sound and price.  Can't ask for much more than that.\n",
      "2958378: Bought as a gift Bought this for a gift, they love it! I love mine! Excellent quality, easy and comprehensive to use! Holds its charge well. Super comfortable. Arrived quickly. By far the best wireless headphones I have owned.\n",
      "32799398: Fantastic and Wife Approved The best report I can give for this product is that I let my wife try it on and she thought it wasn't working at all.. the sound was so good she assumed it was coming from the TV & stereo in the room, until she noticed she couldn't hear me asking her about them.I'm not the audio technology expert, so I'll leave the detailed reporting to others.  I'll just say that I bought these the day they came out and I've been thoroughly impressed with the headset.  Besides the excellent sound quality, they feel comfortable, the buttons are well placed, and it just is a great product.  Would recommend.\n",
      "36427719: Great Headset, Finally! I have had my PS4 since launch day and have been waiting for a great headset to come out because my girlfriend likes to go to sleep while I play games sometimes.  I have gone through 4 different headsets and have not found one that works perfectly yet, until now.  The newest 1.61 PS4 update has helped a lot with the wireless connections, but this headset is far and away the best option.  It is comfy, the sound is fantastic and the battery life is actually pretty great.  I wore them for a number of hours straight and had zero problems with it. The only part that bugs me is the little USB adapter that sticks out of one of your two useable USB ports in the front of the system, but that is a minor complaint.Overall I would say this is the best headset you can get for the PS4 currently as I have tried a large number of them out.  Do yourself a favor and pick these up!\n",
      "41181850: Worth your money trust me. When I first heard of these I got excited. Then I watched a review by IGN and then had doubts. They said they felt cheap and don't deliver on the sound and don't compare to high end headsets. First off let me say they do not feel cheap. There is actually a decent weight to them. Of course nothing is gonna compare to a set of three to five hundred dollar headsets, but I don't have that kinda money to blow nor would I spend that much anyway. Plus some of the high end sets are too big and heavy for long sessions. Not to mention no hidden mic. (At least on some.) I was very pleased with the sound that came out of these. I've been listening to electronic music most of my life and love me some good headphones. So I don't say it lightly when I say they sound good. On top of good sound they look damn cool too. And on top of that, they're easy to figure out and the free app on the PS store lets you use preset sound configs or let's you tweak it to your own liking. Or you can just use the standard setting. Charging is easy too. Plug into your USB and there's a red indicator light on the bottom of the headphones letting you know it's charging. Trust me, I like IGN, but they're wrong about these. They must have boatloads of money and can afford headsets with diamonds and stuff in them so anything other than top of the line will seem inferior to them. But for a regular gamer and music lover like myself, these were worth every darn penny. Trust me\n",
      "43696976: Unparalled Quality and Style for Price I bought these Gold Wireless Headsets to use with my PS3 and my PS4. They are soo sexy. They feel great wearing them on my head, and the voice control works well with games like Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition (PS4). I have also played Killzone: Shadow Fall and Battlefield 4 with this headset, and I am very happy with my purchase.I wanted to get a headset so I can play when I am putting my kids to bed, and I don't want any loud noises, but I still get to experience the clarity of the game. Also, I previously had been using the PS3 Bluetooth Headset for voice chat with buddies, and this is a major improvement. The 7.1 surround sound is was very clear and the microphone picked up my commands on the first attempt with PS4. I would suggest these to any gamer who wants to have a great headset without breaking the bank on more expensive ($200-$350) other sets available.\n",
      "11331612: Great headset for a great price. If you are looking for an excellent inexpensive headset to play on the PlayStation 4, these are it! I bought them to try them out and I am really impressed with the quality. Every time I play Battlefield, I become deaf. The gun fire, explosions, jets, helicopters, all the action that happens sounds really good. The microphone is invisible but the quality is also great. The battery lasts from 7 to 8 hours and it's so easy to set up. I also used them for the PlayStation 3 and it's the same great quality. The material of the headset is plastic and is delicate. Make sure you put a warranty just in case. Other than that, I'm definitely keeping these. Great buy for a great price.\n",
      "35405693: Very Comfy to wear. My first wireless headset and so far i'm pleased. These are really comfy even after 4 hour gaming sessions no discomfort (I have a large head and wear glasses). Battlefield sounds great so do single player games like Tomb Raider. There pretty light weight all plastic, how long will they last? if your an adult who takes care of your S*** then they should last along time weather there plastic or metal.99$ Good price and they work with pretty much any device, I've used them with PS4,PS3,PC, and Phone.\n",

      "51177597: These are great! I didn't purchase these from Amazon because I was able to get them sooner somewhere else.  But I did want to post a quick review to let others know how great these are.  For starters, they are super comfortable.  I haven't felt any fatigue while wearing them for long periods.  Secondly, the built-in mic is awesome.  I love not having a mic boom to worry about and the quality seems fine.  Not sure what others are referring to.  If the USB bluetooth adapter wasn't required, I'd give this 5 stars.  For something so small, you'd think Sony could have built that right into the console.  It's not a deal breaker though - but something that would have made it even better.  Overall I'm very pleased.\n",
      "37111660: works on ps4, couldn't get mic to work on ps3 I have the PS3 version as well.  With the latest PS4 update, i was able to use the PS3 headphones on the ps4, but the sound quality (especially the mic) isn't that good.  I had already pre-ordered these before the software update, so I left the order in place.The gold on the ps4 are better sounding than the PS3 models on the PS3, I think. and they work.I put the Gold on the PS3 just to see what would happen, and I couldn't get the mic to work.  I didn't play around with any settings, I just put them back on the PS4.So, the general rule of thumb here is, use the older PS3 versions on the PS3, and the Gold on the PS4.The biggest improvement is these do NOT CREAK like the PS3 headset.  Those are very creaky, you have to sit perfectly still or the headphones creak constantly, the plastic pieces rubbing against each other.  That design flaw appears to be fixed in the Gold.  Time will tell I guess.Now, if they could just release some games for the PS4 so we can use these awesome headphones.\n",
      "51794675: They're comfy, but don't sound great.  PS4's sound output doesn't do the job. EDIT: I'm just updating this review to say-- I've been using a different headset more recently for the PS4 (high quality studio headphones) and have similar issues with the weak bass.  While I didn't try the Sony Headphones with anything else besides the PS4, they simply didn't get good bass response, even messing with the Headphone Companion app.  But comparing them to my studio headphones through the controller headphone port, the results weren't a ton better.  I can't recommend $100 headphones that you have to charge when the PS4 can't even utilize them fully.Original review: I purchased the Gold Wireless headset for my PS4, hoping it would be a high quality solution for headphones.  Unfortunately, they're terrible.  They come in a fancy blue box, and opening them was a joy, but the minute I heard the quality of the headset I was disappointed, and using the 'Headphone Companion App' on PS4 doesn't help one bit.They are comfy, but the frequency response is one of the worst I've ever heard, especially for $100.  The bass is practically nonexistent.  When you hear a nearby explosion in game, you won't feel like you're there-- you'll hear a tinny version of the explosion.  They don't sound particularly natural in the higher ranges either.Do yourself a favor, and just buy a pair of wired headphones that have decent bass response.  You won't have to worry about charging them, or taking up one of your USB slots, or accidentally leaving them on.\n",
      "38975150: Great headset for the price Great headset for the price. Setup is simple, sound is good, and it has all the features you want in a headset. Easy to mute, easy to turn chat volume or game volume up or down, has different sound modes, and it has sidetone. They are comfortable as well and they are easy to fold up. The sound in VSS is not as high quality as when you set them to stereo. So if you want the best quality sound, set them for stereo (there is a button that changes this on the headset). If you want more of a virtual surround sound experience, where you can pick out footsteps and gunfire around, you should use VSS. Lasts about 7-8 hours on one charge. Comfort wise, they are great, even if you wear glasses.\n",
      "39650126: Decent I just picked these up from Gamestop because I had some gift cards there and couldn't wait to try them out.  I was upgrading from the sony original 7.1 surround sound headset which came out 3-4 years ago so I assumed there would be a pretty big difference in sound quality/functionality.  I was wrong.  The original headset is MUCH easier to use due to the rocker style volume/chat setting and mute button.  There was no guessing where the bottom would be and it didnt take forever to change the sound to the volume you wanted.  Now you are fumbling around on the ear piece trying to figure out which buttons you're pressing.  They should have stuck with the rocker style.  I could tell no difference the downloadable audio pack from the normal setting. Also, the sound quality is worse in this headset than it was on the original.  The bass is worse and the actual volume is lower.  I cant think of anything better about this head than the original besides looks alone and the battery life does last longer.  Im returning these and sticking with what works best.\n",
      "16382261: great product This is my first set of gaming headphones and I have nothing but praise for these in what you get for the price. I'm sure there are more expensive options out there that probably have better overall sound but since I've never used them I don't have anything to compare to and see nothing wrong with these. $99.00 and you get wireless 71 surround sound, it just doesn't get much better than that in my opinion.\n",
      "37278218: What is the diference????/ I CHANGE MY MIND First i want to say is i sold the first edition of the ps headphones for $50. Took the money and got the Gold. i put them on,and i must say they are comforable. They are not BULKY, and u can actually put them in a safe place. Now I'm playing COD . I have the settings on 2 , but they sound like my OLD headsets( where is the BASS??? ) Then i downloaded the app, uploaded on Shooter ,went back to COD , and it sounds THE SAME!!!! Went back to the app, customize my settings myself, turn the bass all the way up, went back to COD, SAME RESULTS!!!! The explosions NEXT to me should have BASS!!!  Another thing I've notice. the volume is too LOW . My old headsets were louder on the ps4 than the Gold. There is NO levels indications on the TV on where the volume is??? At least on the ps3 headset , they have sliders and u can TELL where the chat/volume are.And one more thing, the (buttons) on the ear piece is HARD to find!!! You got to have a light touch to find the chat/volume (buttons). Overall, I hope the ps4 have another update about these issues. As far as the headset, they are ALRIGHT!!!!!2/21/14OK , I change my mind!!!! What SONY didn't tell u that u have to DOWNLOAD the new update to the headphones!!! U go to the app, plug in the headphones to the USB cord,then u hit the option button, a DEFAULT SETTING will appear, hit X , and it will tell u need an update!!! Why Sony didn't tell us about this in the instructions!!! NOW I HAVE BASS!!!! These headphones are incredible!!! Better than my OLD ONES!!!! THE SOUND IS OFF THE HOOK!!!! SONY DID IT AGAIN!!! So please do not take ur headphones BACK!!! They are not defective!! Sony mess up on the instuctions!!!!!\n",
      "3274172: WTF Okay, first of all, the sound, is terrible. For me, it's always either muffled, scratchy, or nothing at all. And the next thing, there is no Mic, or at least not in the right place. For headphones compatible with PS4, you need a Microphone connected to the head piece. Thank goodness I got the money back.\n",
      "11289658: Fantastic Product! Ordered from Ireland, got the headset in just 4 daysFantastic product. I don't get all the complaints about this item. Surround is fantastic, quality is more than good, headset feels solid enough and it's properly finished.Headset feels great, not heavy and not tired after hours of use.Great value for money. Don't waste your time with other more expensive models, this is fantastic.Recommended!\n",
      "12436829: Works like a dream! No static, loud sound, mic works well, comfortable, seems sturdy enough -- I have no complaints at all! If you want a good headset that you know will work, get this one.\n",
      "23960826: Just not as good as the previous model IMO I've been using the Sony PlayStation PULSE Elites for a couple years now. Great sound and mic quality, it's a perfect gaming headset. I should've figured this would be a &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; type situation, because this headset is $30 cheaper than it's predecessor.Now don't get me wrong, this headset looks awesome, and the sound quality is amazing. But if you play a lot of games with your friends, you're probably gonna want to be able to communicate with them while you play. This headset's mic is a huge downgrade from the PULSE Elites.I did my own mic test comparing the previous model and the Golds using the &#34;Voice Changer&#34; setting on the Playstation itself.My voice on the Golds sounded very soft and quiet; just very low to the point to where I could talk in a regular tone of voice and barely hear myself. I also sounded a bit muffled and a little bit &#34;echo-y&#34; as well. And just like other people say in these reviews, I sounded like I was &#34;in a box.&#34; My friends also gave me feedback on the headset as I talked over the mic.Pros to the headset:-VERY comfortable-They have a modern and simple style-Very high quality sound-Light-weight-Portable; they fold in on the sides-Changeable faceplates-Affordable priceCons:-Crappy microphone-Comes with a 5-6 inch Micro-USB; not suitable for playing while charging-Feels cheap, you can really tell the whole thing is made of plasticAlthough there are more pros than cons, IMO, the mic really takes the hardest hit because I play a lot of multiplayer games.I was just really disappointed by the microphone, which is why I'll be returning these and continue using my Elites.Keep in mind this is MY honest opinion about the headset. If you like all the pros, go ahead and get 'em. If you want an upgrade from the Elites and you rely on the microphone like me, do NOT get these. the Elite's mic is waaay better than the Golds.tl;dr:Great product in almost all ways, but my only issue is the mic. (The mic is REALLY bad)se. the Elite's mic is waaay better than the Golds.tl;dr:Great product in almost all ways, but my only issue is the mic. (The mic is REALLY bad)\n",
      "37512843: Great Value for $100. What's up with the dongle, though? Just received this headset today and had about half a day to play with it. Setup is easy. Plug the dongle in, turn on the headset, and off you go. Do download the companion app to fine tune the bass, mids, and highs. Works flawlessly with my laptop and desktop. I was able to use it for my Skype calls and the audio quality is quite good. I was told that my voice was clear as well.I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. I have a pair of Sennheiser HD598 headphones and a 5.1 Yamaha surround system that I use to listen to most of my music. However, I will not be comparing the Sony headset to neither the Sennheisers nor the Yamaha 5.1 as they are used for different purposes and cost nowhere close to $100.Pros:- Sound quality. Quite decent when taking into consideration the $100 price tag. I've played Battlefield 4 with these and the gunfire sounded quite satisfying, although it took a bit of tweaking to get the bass just right. I'd say that 99% of people would be satisfied with how this headset sounds for most applications. It gets pretty loud too and I couldn't play with full volume on as it was just too loud for me. - Comfort. Very comfortable and light. These are wireless, so no need to worry about that annoying cable that connects to your controller. Padding is soft. Seems like it is made of plastic leather, so ears could get somewhat warm, but I have yet to find it uncomfortable.- Compatibility. I was surprised actually that this headset works pretty much with everything out there. I did not read up on this headset as I just wanted to replace the &#34;headset&#34; that came with PS4. Just plug in the dongle to your PC and/or Mac and you will have a wireless stereo headset. You can also use this headset with your phone, PS3, and/or PS Vita. I have an iPhone and this headset works with it when connected via the included 3.5mm wire. It is not wireless, but still nice of Sony to make it compatible with pretty much every platform you would be using a headset on (minus Xbox consoles, obviously).- Battery. I have not charged my headset since opening it and have been using it for about 3 hours already. Sony states that these last for about 8 hours. I would not be surprised if they actually do last that long or slightly longer if you don't blast them at full volume.Cons:- The USB dongle. Why, oh why did Sony make it so that this headset uses a USB dongle instead of Bluetooth? PS4 and most other devices have built in Bluetooth adapters. In case you are not aware, PS4 only has 2 USB ports. Mine only has 1 now with the dongle taking up 50% of USB ports. It also doesn't look that aesthetically pleasing. The dongle is pretty small, but still...- Virtual Surround Sound. I found it to be complete crap. With the VSS off, I found the headset to be much better sounding in simple stereo mode. If you are looking for surround sound in a headset, then get yourself something that has dedicated 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. Virtual surround sound in my opinion is useless in a stereo headset. It could be just me as other people like the VSS feature. Not really a con as you can turn it off though.Overall, I like this headset a lot. I don't think you can get a better bang for your buck. It's wireless, sounds decent, works with pretty much anything that has a USB port or a 3.5mm jack, has very good battery life, and comfortable to wear. If it was working via Bluetooth, I would love it even more.\n",
      "30907786: Great Headset, easy to set up and use I will admit that this is my 1st wireless gaming headset purchase. That being said, these are Great! I have used them with my PS4 and the virtual surround is right on, I can tell if the sound is coming at me from in front, left, back, or right, and any combo of those directions (i.e. rear left, front right, etc.) The sound is clear and the Bass is there. Using them with my PC was very simple, plug in the usb dongle, wait about 3 seconds, and ready to go. The microphone works good too, my friends were able to hear me clearly. I would recommend these to anyone. I don't know if more expensive sets sound better, but I doubt they could sound much better.\n",
      "16858871: Great for the price! 1st of all, i did not buy these from amazon, i was at a best buy and had heard about them and figured why not?  Keep in mind i am not an audiophile and hardly ever use headphones except for the 20 dollar ones i use with my portable systems.  That said i think the audio quality is fine, i have played tomb raider de, cod ghosts and watched an action movie with them.I was concerned about two things, one people said they do not get loud enough but i was pleasently surprised that they get plenty loud.  I am not able to use them at max volume, too loud for me, and in my opinion anyone using them at max and still wanting more has already lost some hearing for listening to headphones too loudly, just some simple irony there.  The 2nd thing that concerned me is the amount of bass, i saw a lot of people say it was lacking.  These have more bass actually than these comments would leave you tobelieve.  Could you ask for more bass?  Of course, but not at this price point.  As log as they had more than i thought going in i'm happy.  Also, a 3rd thing is people said these don't work for music or movies.  I don't know about music but i watched a movie last night with them and they sounded good to me.Here is my only gripe, and it has nothng to do with design, comfort or the dongle because those things don't matter to me, in my opinion those are a stupid thing to judge it on.  No, what i really think is stupid is that you need to have the usb cable plugged into the phones to upload whatever mode you want from the companion app.  I kept hitting upload and it kept saying headset not ready, then i realized it needs the cable plugged in, that to me is stupid and my only gripe.\n",
      "20757006: Love them... Pro:- Awesome Sound Quality- Comfortable- Price- Design- Volumelv. great- Bass very good- Batterylife very goodCons:...nothingI can recommend this HS !\n",
      "45666187: A great value choice. I have had some time with SONY's new PS4/all around headset and while there are some minor issues it is a good choice for the budget customer looking for quality gaming sound.Aesthetics- ***** the phones look sleek and streamlined. The mic is built into the earphones so there is nothing sticking out. Five star look.Comfort- **** Very comfortable to wear for extended use. After two hours of gaming and three episodes of dexter my ears did start to hurt and become uncomfortable so you can wear them for about five hours.These do not hurt the top of your head your ears start to get sore. Four star comfort.Sound- **** First of all SONY has a companion app for this set downloadable on PSN. It has pre-set packets for gaming , movie etc . You have to hook your headset to the PS4 and download each packet every time you play or watch which is kind of annoying. Say you are playing a shooter and have the shooter packet on your set. When you switch to netflix you have to plug your set into the PS4 and download the movie pack then when going back to the game plug it in and download the shooter pack. That aside the sound is very good and high quality with the option for surround sound. I will say that Turtle Beach does sound crisper and better then these headsets but those sets are a lot more money as well. Four stars for sound.Layout- *** The layout for buttons isn't the best. The buttons themselves are so flush you can barely feel them. There is a chat button but no light indicator and nothing pops up on screen saying chat enabled. So feasibly you can accidentally have chat on and not even know it. Also I have put the set on backwards a lot then I have to take the set off to find the buttons. Three stars for layout.Durability- *** The set is collapsible which is nice for traveling but seems kinda cheap in construction. We will see on this but I think if you are closing it every day it may crack or break after awhile. ifyou do not plan on closing and opening these all the time it should last forever. Three stars for durability.Misc- The set is charged via USB. The charge takes about an hour or so and lasts 4-5 hours. You can also use these headphones with pretty much any other device which is a cool thing sony did.Heh, it's a hundred bucks and has surround sound and wireless. Easily the best value in headsets currently.\n",
      "45801382: good enough this head set is great for what I need them for which is basically to talk online with my friends and use them to hear music. the headset is not like beats but for the price that sony as them for and it being one of the few headset that could be used for ps4 there not bad.\n",
      "31818062: Gold Wireless 7.1 vs. Astro A40 and 4 other headsets I've spent the last couple weeks searching for a new headset. Last week I added the new Gold Wireless to the mix and put them up against the others in a shootout. I've been a recording musician and sound engineer for 25+ years. I explain the whole thought process I went through to come to my ultimate decision. The result kinda surprised me. I made a video to explain. I'd be interested to know what you think.http://youtu.be/2Y0ietlIYiI\n",
      "52192706: Very Good Sounding Headset These phones have excellent audio for this price level.  Very detailed.  However they do not go to ear splitting sound pressure levels -which is a good thing if you do not want to permanently damage your hearing.  What I do not like is that they use a clunky USB dongle that is much larger than is needed to be.  Why not use a miniature dongle like Microsoft uses for its mouses and keyboards?  The thing extends too much out from the front of the PS 4 front USB ports.  Just looks cheap.All in all these are good phones for the price but could have been better.\n",
      "11630681: Excellent for the PS4! This headset is perfect for the PS4. I think most of the negative reviews come from people expecting this headset to be more than just a gaming headset and it is not. Even though the headset can be used for music and movies, this headset was designed for gaming with a PS4 and therefore its main purpose is for gaming. For the PS3, I use to have what was called &#34;The Official PS3 Wireless Stereo Headset&#34; which was priced at $99 when it came out, I'm not comparing it to the &#34;Elite&#34; because I never had it. Compared to the PS3 one it feels more updated, more modern and definitely comes with more. They both have 7.1 Virtual Surround Sound but this one is compatible with the Companion App which you can add specific gaming modes. If feels more comfortable when wearing it and because the microphone is already integrated you don't have the little microphone stick which at times use to feel like it was dangling. One big update which can be a negative is the folding of the corners. It is convenient for storage and traveling but thats what makes people think the headset was built cheap. I personally don't think it feels cheap but then again its a $99 which is technically a deal compared to more advanced headsets. The audio is amazing, you can hear footsteps, wind, birds, and anything around you. It comes with some accessories you can see with the items description and a nice bag to store your headset. Again, I'm basing my review on the previews headset this &#34;Gold&#34; one is meant to replace which was the PS3 one. The audio is amazing. I'm not an audiophile, Im just a part time gamer and this headset is for sure a great addition to your PS4.\n",
      "42829880: Awesome-7.1 Virtual Surround and Voice chat and control! These are killer.  Plug in the dongle, turn them on, and you get truly immersive sound.  You hear sounds you can never hear on your TV speakers.  The surround is real.  You'll never want to go back to TV speakers after hearing everything movies and films have to offer in surround sound.  Playing Killzone: Shadow Fall is super immersive; you hear sounds all around you; sounds you never heard before.  You can actually hear \\\\\"where\\\\\" the sound is coming from, which I think improves your gaming abilities.A huge bonus is being able to instantly control the PS4 by voice, by saying \\\\\"Playstation\\\\\", then whatever you want to do.This headset was well worth the cost,  Very cool.\n",
      "12038068: Sound Quality is Amazing! The setup is easy, the sound is great, and the buttons are clearly laid out. Easy enough right? Heck yes it is! These headphones are huge, Thank You Sony! They fit my ''larger than normal'' head. They are over-the-ear headphones, and the virtual 7.1 sounds insane. These headphones DO NOT feature bluetooth, instead you have to plug in a USB dongle to your console. I personally think Sony had to do this to get superior sound, whereas bluetooth may have had loss of audio quality. I do not understand why some call these headphones flimsy or cheap, in my opinion they are built just fine.Simply put, I'd highly recommend these. Very Satisfied Indeed.\n",
      "39124943: Audio not quite there I purchased these from Gamestop because amazon still had it on preorder.  I returned them the next day because these just do not get loud enough and the bass just isn't there.  I downloaded the companion app and used the Shooter profile and that helped slightly but was not what I was expecting.  They also feel cheap, kind of like a toy for a child. I guess for what they cost, they would be acceptable but I need to feel the immersion when gaming and LOUD audio, big booms and footsteps.  My new headset cost 3X (A50) that these did but they are exactly what I was looking for.  I did not get to test the chat feature on these though. :(\n",
      "31436963: Really kick ass wireless headset ! I was really excited to get these guys when after reading others reviews of the headset. I was initially worried that due to the price ($99) the quality would suffer, but I was not disappointed! The sound quality is good and I really like how the mic lets you hear your own voice so you don't feel like you have earplugs in. My only complaint so far is that it seems a bit *tight* on how it hugs my ears but only noticeable after a couple of hours of use. This is the only thing keeping it from being a 5 star. I think that the more I wear them, it will loosen up. I actually have been storing them wrapped over the original box so the rest expanded out which helps. The ear pads seem to be made out of some nice plush material and is adjustable up and down. Overall, I would definitely recommend these for the ps4 and pc.Pros :- Sound- Mic- Look and feelCons- Cannot connect directly to it (ex. through your phone)So So:- Tighter head band\n",
      "10203418: Can't beat this for the price! After extensive use for the past few days I can confirm that these headsets are worth the $99 price tag. I have used many headsets before, most notably Tritton 720+ and at times I feel like these headphones can compete or even succeed those headsets in overall value. Personally, the design of these headsets are simplistic yet stylish. I don't understand why people are concerned for design anyway, you're paying for audio. I love the black and blue color choice to complement the ps4. I also like and prefer adjustable earpieces as well.The sound of these headsets overall surprised me quite a bit. I've been reading reviews and I was expecting to be disappointed by I was pleasantly surprised. The audio fidelity was comparable to the 720+ in terms of depth but the overall clarity of these headsets surpass the 720+. I always thought the 720+ came across as scratchy and the sound would crackle during explosions or during times where the bass would be tested. The Gold Headset is overall clear and comes through with considerable clarity. I do feel that it could have a bit more bass especially when connected to mobile devices but it's not non-existent. I want more bass because I have owned more expensive headsets but for the price the bass is up-to-par with you expect or better. The companion app also allows you to adjust the bass so once you do that you should be satisfied.Overall, these headphone surprised me quite a bit. Sony did a good job with these and if you have a ps4, these should be on your list. I plan on pairing these with my astro a40 mixamp which I also purchased in order to compare so I will update my review on that as well.\n",
      "2061203: NOT AS EXPECTED Headphone little chuck, sound better than a good imagination, not as good as advertised 8 hours battery, only six hours, I have applied for return, the future may not buy this type of headphones\n",
      "13186378: Awesome headphones! These things are amazing, I am so happy with these headphones! The setup is so easy and the sound quality is awesome!\n",
      "15110024: Pretty cheapy. I had the feeling that I wouldn't be impressed with these before I bought them and it turns out that I should have listened to my gut. However since it was an officially licensed product and I can't find the Camera in stock anywhere I decided to give them a go.Good1. Packaging was nice and even includes a nice little pull string toat bag for carrying them around.2. Setup was extremely simple.3. It's use of the dongle while a negative to me, makes it very compatible. PC, Mac, PS4, PS3, and even the Vita or other game system via the headphone jack.Bad1. The build quality is on the cheap side. I don't expect the world for $99 plus tax but these felt like they could break with even normal wear and tear. Their fold up function for instance seems completely unnecessary and compounds their flimsiness.2. The max volume was quite low and even lower when I tried to balance in some chat via the buttons on the headset.3. The headset is NOT Bluetooth compatible. A very sad state of affairs when the PS4, the PS3, and I am told that even the Vita has Bluetooth capability yet this set requires the USB dongle.4. You have to charge them for 3 hours before use. A little thing but annoying when you are ready to play with a new toy.5. They are extremely uncomfortable. They were very tight on my head and the earpieces are very plastic. Like a solid rubber mold rather than the nice soft cloth of my UV Sony cans.Basically they are just a poor value. I bought mine at Best Buy and returned them the next day. I replaced them with the $25 Rocketfish ones for now until a better version becomes available.\n",
      "31736880: Great sound and excellent value These wireless headphones came pre charged and instantly connected to my PS3 once connecting the USB adapter. They also work with the PS4 and provide a full range of sound with an effortless setup. My wife no longer has to listen to the ambient sounds of gunfire when I play Call if Duty or Bioshock. Communication works better than the included PS4 microphone, charge lasts about 8 hours. It is possible to play and charge, but I'd recommend getting a longer USB cable. The included 3.5mm audio jack allows these headphones to work with anything. Highly recommended!\n",
      "43691203: Wireless and work instantly, they are great. So far, they work great and the set up was literally plug and play. Comfortable. My battery lasted 8hrs. Also, you can use the same cord that charges the controller, so you can charge as you use them. Slight distortion when you yell. A little crackly, but it sounds clear and they have customizable settings with the free app on the PSN. Also, they are a little flimsy at the ear cup folds, so be gentle.I've been wanting a wireless gaming headset for a long time, but my tv doesn't have an audio input other then digital, so... These were perfect.Definite buy\n",
      "8254606: I LOVE THESE!!!!!! HANDS DOWN THE BEST VALUE FOR WIRELESS SURROUND SOUND HEADPHONES I USE THE SHOOTER SETTING IN THE PS4 COMPANION APP I LOVE THESE HEADSETS NO REGRETS!\n",
      "39352703: wireless headphones 4 my PS4... Decent wireless headset for the price,  comfortable except makes my ears get to warm, must be the material.....  As for the sound, you get what you paid for,  I would say the sound is a bit above average...\n",
      "38908519: Worth the buy If you need a new pair of headphones for gaming and don't have the $$ to buy the top dog these are for sure worth it. Playing killzone SF I can hear people sneaking up on me. Guns sound more legit. You can also play with the bass and treb so you don't really need bass impact. You get your $$ worth and more.\n",
      "12713750: Worth every penny! I'm going to keep it simple and short, the headset is very comfy, well built, the sound/chat quality is crisp and clear, and it's wireless. I have the astro a40's that are $200+ and these headsets are just as good as the astro's. The companion app is very easy to use, have your headset plugged in via micro usb and download the audio profile you desire.Pros:ComfyWell builtGreat sound qualityVery easy to useAffordable\n",
      "35189447: These are pretty good. Pretty much what everyone else has said about sound and quality being great. Only thing that I would say brings this to a 4 over a 5 is the fact that the max volume could be a little bit better. I was playing GTA5 on PS3, obviously, and it sounds great, but I wish I can turn it up maybe one or two more nothces.Maybe not? See below.I threw in Transformers Dark of the Moon into the PS3 and it sounded like I was in the thearter. I then threw the same movie into my PS4 and have to say these headsets seem to have more volume to them on the PS4. I am very satisfied with these on the PS4. Maybe all the volume concerns are coming from people using these on the PS3 only.\n",
      "12738951: PS gets the gold with these headset I have been waiting for the official PS4 cans to be released but got sick of the wait and got some Turtle Beach PX4s last month. While the TBs satisfied my desires and more, I didn't expect this headset to blow the TB out of the water! I bought these over the past weekend and am already in love with them.My expectations admittedly weren't high because of the reasonable price point, but it's obvious Sony really put effort into producing a gaming headset with good sound quality. There will be plenty of professional reviews about quality of sound so I'll leave the technicalities to them, but for gaming this headset will go beyond your needs.Design:I'm not a fan of the look at all. When rumors were circulating and pictures were released over the previous months, I was sure they were nothing more than rumors cause why would Sony release a headset so ugly? In person, however, the headset is pretty stylish...weird, I know. Then again, it's not like I'll be looking at the headset while it's on my head anyway!They are comfortable enough to wear for the entire run of battery life (I've gotten 8 hrs so far) and they charge very quickly (about 45 mins on empty, in my experience). The only downside is the pleather used on the cups themselves don't breathe as well as the TB headsets, but it's by no means a deal breaker. Also, I wear think plastic glasses with these on and there is absolutely no issue whatsoever.The headset has the ability to fold, which is a great convenience, and comes with a travel case! Setup is nonexistent as all you have to do is plug in the USB \\\\\"gumstick\\\\\" and fire up these puppies. Once you do that, they work immediately. The USB stick isn't a distraction, but would have been great if Sony have eliminated the need for it.Durability:It's obvious that Sony cut alot of corners to keep the price of the headset down, so in some ways they feel cheap yet sturdy. I wouldn't leave these around very young children if it can be avoided, but they can take some jostling.Sound:IMHO the sound is really good. I realize these aren't made to compete with the Boses of the world, so for gaming they're superb. The virtual 7.1 channel surround sound is impressive and effective; markedly better than the PX4s...I mean the difference is night and day! The sound stage feels a bit more natural and less stiff, also you really feel immersed in the game. With the PX4s I could tell someone was around me in BF4 but not where they were...with the Gold's I can tell exactly where they are. Planes flying overhead and boats running nearby are easily detectable. The mic is hidden and works well too; my friends have all mentioned how clear my voice comes through.You can select \\\\\"flat\\\\\" sound by selecting '1' on the headset, or get a bit more low-end effect (LFE, bass) by selecting '2.' With the companion app, see below, '2' sound profile can be replaced with presets from developers.The controls for the headset are all on the hardware itself, so until you become familiar with where all the buttons are you will have to take them off to see what buttons you're pushing but you'll adjust quickly.The companion app:The app was released this week and works as a mixer. It comes with 2 presets for gaming, movies, and music, plus a free preset for you to customize (low, mid, high) in each section for a total of 9 different presets. I am excited to see how they expand the utility of the app.One thing to keep in mind: the headset and the PS4 don't keep the preset saved so you'll have to \\\\\"load\\\\\" it each time you turn on the PS4. A small annoyance but only takes an extra 10 seconds of time.***Correction: the headset preset does in fact save until it is replaced with another or restored to default. Also, as of this review, the headset must be plugged in to change presets or restore factory defaults.***I tried to be objective with this review, but I can't help the fact that this headset is so great regardless of price point. I would recommend it to a friend, family, or stranger. If you're on the fence about these just go ahead and get them, break them in for a few hours, then you'll understand!\n",
      "25666456: Chat is horrible ! I love everything ALMOST but...The chat on these things is a total FAIL.My friend was on his ps4 and we were playing a bit of cod ghosts. He is a tech support genius and neither he or myself armed with google links all over kingdom come could figure it out. So I am sending these back. And that is a shame cause it seems Sony got everything else right. So here is what I experienced....1 - I could not hear my own voice. This might seem silly but when you are used to TBs helping you here your voice as loud explosions are happening it is sorely missed. Not hearing myself though was not as bad as simply trying to get to chatting.2- there is definitely a lack of instructions for setting the correct settings. So we were left guessing and then when we seemed to be right suddenly it was not and made no sense.3 - more than half the time in and out of various games he could hear me but I could not hear him4- and when I did hear him there was no way to control the incoming chat volume separately of the game volume. The volume turns both up or down at same rate. I stii have. I idea what the chat/sound buttons really do. It made no sense nor is it explained in the instructions.5- no way to move mic back to help listener. The mic on TBs is quick to move out of way in case of cough. This one requires you to find the hard to reach mute buttonSo back to amazon. Sony had a huge chance here how did they get chat so very wrong - crazy\n",
      "18826712: Better than Pulse Elite Edition! But not the best Sony headset (UPDATE: I just changed the rating to 4 stars, because I just found the perfect headphones from Sony: MDR-HW700DS Wireless Digital Surround Headphones System. http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-HW700DS-Wireless-Surround-Headphones/dp/B00FJISYZQ/ref=cm_cr-mr-title But don't get me wrong. These are still a great choice if you are on a budget)I usually don't write reviews, but now that I have tried and bought these headphones, I'm so in love with them that I had to spread this love; Let me tell you, I had owned all 3 generations of Sony PS headphones, and like that old saying, the 3rd time is the charm.Design is great, as it features a bold contrast of color and weights less than a pound. I wear them for hours and I don't notice them at all. They fixed that awkward headband of the pulse elite that often leaves marks all over your head after wearing them for more than 30 minutes. I can confirm that problem was solved!.Music sounds rich and with lots of bass and clear sound.I have a mac and they work fine, with the exception of features that would only work with a PlayStation console, Like the VSS or the effects you can load to mode 2 through the PS4 app.Loving the fact that I can actually fold them and keep them in their own custom travel pouch which look great with the PS logo on it.If you are on the fence or have at least a small interest in them, I would say, go ahead and buy them, you won't regret it.Thank you for taking the time to read my honest review.\n",
      "41869888: Best version so far I've made it my point to own each iteration of the Pulse Headset Sony has made. The Elite was the best until this version but, I noticed the head band to be extremely uncomfortable when worn for more than 2 hours. This version corrects the issue. The band at the top is almost identical to the Pulse while retaining the hidden mic and line in features of the Elites. They abandoned the old style sliders on the sides for volume adjustment in favor of digital buttons. My only complaint is that it takes a good bit of tweaking to get Chat and Game volume properly balanced. But, the other features and sound quality make up for it. The battery life lasts quite a while as well. It also has moved to Micro USB like the other PS4 devices for charging. The Gold headset lacks the Bass Impact feature of the Elite, but I did not even know it was there when I had my Elite.\n",
      "21776388: Great Value Pros:-Great Sound-Very Comfortable Over-Ear-Price-PS4 App to Adjust EQ to Preset or Custom-Great Battery-Personally like the lack of a mic boom makes using them as headphones for other devices less goofyCon:-Has dongle but its small and matches the PS4 in finish\n",
      "39112212: A great buy for PS4 and/or PC I needed a new headset, and the idea of plugging a wired one into my PS4 controller or PC didn't sound appealing. I saw that this was only going for $99.99 at a local brick and mortar so I scooped one up. It's an extremely effective headset for $100, rivaling many I've tried that were $50-$100 more expensive.(+) Comfortable and easy to adjust. The buttons are laid out well and easy to manipulate while the headset is on your head(+) The sound quality is very high, especially for a headset in this price range. The virtual 7.1 surround sound works amazingly well with bluray movies and games, providing a cheap and immersive experience - especially if you do not want to invest in a pricey sound system for your home. The overall audio quality is far superior to any other $100-$150 headset I've tried, but still below \\\\\"high end\\\\\" products. Note: the 7.1 surround only works with a PS3 or PS4, it is not supported when using this with a PC - for good reason, because your PC hardware and playback software may not support it(+) The hidden microphone is precise and clear. PSN friends mentioned how crisp I sounded, with no interference or accidental vocalizations(+) No hassle setup on PS4 or PC: just plug in the dongle and turn on the headsets(+) Quality fabrication for $100. Nothing remarkable, but it certainly doesn't feel cheap and seems like it will last. It folds up nicely for storage and features removable cover plates for customization(+) The ability to upload custom sound profiles using the companion app is a nice addition. You can switch between 2, with Sony offering many presets as well as the ability to customize (Bass, Mid, and Treble). Game developers will be able to offer custom profiles for their games that one can upload to the headset\n",
      "49326157: Can't go wrong for $99 For the price, this is an absolute must buy. The virtual surround sound is excellent for people who have roommates or family members in the house to keep noise down. Battery life is decent, but it charges extremely quickly. The chat quality is top-notch as well, and the microphone is hidden as well. I'm also excited to try out the custom sound modes for certain games (via an app to be released in the future). It is very stylish and portable, and even comes with a nice carrying pouch.And if nothing else, it is great just to use as a regular pair of headphones for your Vita, smartphone, tablet or anything with a headphone jack. Highly recommended headset.\n",
      "10917659: Good price, good sound, comfortable and long battery. I'm not an audiophile but I am a tech perfectionist. Every gadget I have I inspect and test and I'm very picky about every little detail. All I can say is that this headset is very good. People complain about the bass but once you get them you can download the companion app and raise the bass all the way up.I had the original Playstation headset and the Pulse Elites and I can tell you this headset is more comfortable and has a better build quality than the older versions.\n",
      "35614673: Perfect For this price, you can't do any better than these.  Works flawlessly with PS4 and PC. Set up is dead simple, just plug and play, even on PC.  No software to install.  The headset itself is quite comfortable and adjustable.  Sound is clear and loud.\n",
      "44985509: Pretty awesome and simple Just got some from GameStop and plugged them in for a round of COD Ghosts.  And the verdict isssssss......Pretty awesome.  I'm sure the more expensive 300 dollar sets of turtle beach are better, but I couldn't imagine by much.  I'm satisfied with my purchase, sound is very good quality and I scored better because of the 7.1 surround sound capability.  Plus it's playstation, software was MADE for these headsets.  Buy them, or don't....let me have the advantage in COD!\n",
      "46720488: Gold wireless bliss Hi I been seeing alot of mixed feeling's on this headset and I thought I would throw my 2 cents in .First off I personally think the headset itself fit's great feel's good and look's stylish also matching the PS4 Look.Set Up- Easy as 1,2,3 you plug in the transmitter into your PS4 and boom it works instantly. First thing I did was start a chat party invited some people and test the chat function . The first thing I noticed was I could not hear my friends all I did was turn up the chat and voila I could hear them they could hear me and the chat was crisp Like an apple .Sound quality  with game's- I popped in Tomb Raider definitive edition and wow was I blown away by the ambiant sound of the lighting striking the wind blowing and all of the other weather effects I was impressedI then popped in Call of duty ghosts and the sound was flat guns sounded bleh and im like errrrr im like did they drop the ball with multiplayer game's  (NOPE)I went to the Playstation App store and they had a new audio app program for this headset and the elite's in one simple application . Basically what you do is  fire up the application pick the headset you are using then pick  what type of game you are playing they have a few choice's .The best choice was an option to turn up the bass, Mid's,And TrebleThis process is simple turn your chat headset to number 2 pick your settings and save it !!! There is nothing to download its that simpleI went back and fired up call of duty ghosts and I put dead silence on and I could hear everyone else walking around witch direction they were comming from and now the gunfire was intenseI also want to state that when I bought a PS4 I bought the Turtle beach Earforce Phantom's and I hate to say it but they just did not sound good hooked up to my PS4 the chat was bland and the audio was sub par if bestI am going to give this headet a solid 5 for the simple fact they are only $99 dollars and it comes with alot of bang for the buckyeah you can go out and get a turtle beach 300 dollar headset or astro's but for me personally I was not impressed by the high end turtles hooked up to the PS4 . Alltho the Turtles sounded great on my Xbox one  please let me know what you all think thx\n",
      "42949696: Exceptional quality and elegance The Gold Wireless Headset for the PS4 truly is the headset for the PS4.  The headset looks downright perfect and almost too good to even want to touch or possibly damage.  The stereo sound quality and option to switch to surround sound is perfect. The added ability to set up profiles for your sound lets you have the perfect movie or game volumes.  Chatting and the ability to mute is very easy.  The charge lasts a relatively long time and it charges pretty fast as well.  It includes a cable to attach to a phone or MP3 which I have not tried, but cant see how it could go wrong.  Comes with a nice cloth bag for all the extra cables and USB transmitter/receiver.  The face plates that are interchangeable are sturdy and show no signs of falling off or rattling.\n",
      "41220663: Everything but the blu I'll keep it short and sweet, these are must buys for any gamer looking for solid alternatives to gaming headsets without having to pay a fortune. The quality of the 7.1 audio sounds very crisp, and with solid bass boosters it really creates an immersive experience. I tested the mic with a friend who bought these as well so I could test the low levels while listening to how he sounded and it really does a good job of capturing your voice as clear as possible which is a shock for the fact it's a hidden mic. So ok, maybe this wasn't short but it's a great buy at $100, the only draw back is there is no blu tooth support and because of that the USB dongle doesn't allow you to be too far from it. But as just mentioned it has a USB dongle and a headphone plug so that you can use it with your ps4, ps3, vita, PC, and phone among others. I tested the music on the iPhone and it does an amazing job with music also. Anyways, that's all I have for you... Go buy them, you won't regret!\n",
      "26712571: Love it - but do NOT install the companion app!!! Really love the headset, the sound is rich and the bass is deep.  However do NOT install the companion app on PS4... If you update the headset's firmware via this app, it will BRICK your headset completely.  I called up Sony and they have literally no clue how to support or fix this headset (since it's so new) - I actually had one lady tell me that they didn't make this headset and couldn't support it.If you get this headset, enjoy it... but do NOT install the companion app.\n",
      "51247623: 3rd Gen Playstation Headset So I have not actually used them yet with the PS3 or PS4 yet, but I wanted to write a little something for those that are thinking about getting it. They are over the ear design. The fit, at least for me, is conferrable. I have had them on for a few minutes and so far are not heavy at all. One of the things that I do not like is that the wireless dangle does not have a 3.5mm input like the Pulse Elite do...big bummer. Why Sony...why. I will update the review after I get to use them.2-13-14So what some people say is true, the bass is almost non-existent. I have several earphones that have more bass, these don't seem to exhibit any at all.\n",
      "47108372: Worst product by Sony yet Sorry I'm a Sony Fan, but this one just can't be helped. Sound quality is nowhere near good. and the build quality is terrible. The pulse elite are much better sound quality, but my broke after less than a year with it.\n",
      "16025653: Only a idiot would get this Pretty sad when people would get this dung because it has &#34;official ps logo&#34; on it. All of this is just a gimmick while not improving the audio much. There are much better headsets out there, but most of you people are sheep and would bend over gladly for whatever Sony offers you. All of you sicken me. Continue wasting your money.\n",
      "30802413: Very Good PS4, PS3, XBOX One Headset Got my Headset and was able to give it an inititial test. These are good headphones for what I believe is the intended market (Game systems).  I find it extrememly annoying that neither the PS4 nor XBox One allowed the use of headsets that people may already have for their previous systems, at least not out of the gate.  My main purpose is to be able to play games without turning up the surround sound and disturbing the entire house.  There is no way ANY headphones can complete with a good surround system.Although Sony advertises these as a gaming headphone that can also be used as a do everything headphone, I believe these should be used on gaming consoles.  In my opinion you can't compare sound quality of these to profession units that cost 2 to 3 times as much for music.  At the same time I would not utilize my stereo headphones to try to dupicate 7.1 surround sounds either.  I was on the fence between these and the Pulse Elite Headphones which at the time of this posting was only $14 more.PROS:- Lightweight.  These are actually comfortable to wear.  Even long term use does not &#34;hurt&#34; the head as much as other units can.- Bass boost is available and does work.- Sound quality is very good.  Surround sound in BF4 was excellent.- Battery life is actually decent.  Not having to constantly charge and/or exchange batteries is a big plus.- Comes with charging cord.- Collapsible; ear cups fold in.- Looks good as an in-home headsetCONS:- Dongle - The use of a dongle for me is a major negative.  The PS4 ability to utilize Bluetooth and to not incorporate this into Sony products is stupid due to several factors.  For one, the PS4 only has 2 USB ports.  You now have to use one of them for the dongle. If you use the second one to charge your controller you don't have another port to charge headphones.  Some people may already have external chargers for their controllers and as such this would be less of an issue.  If you don't I can see managing the ports by plugging and unplugging various items becoming annoying quickly.- Lightweight is a negative as well and I question the long term longevity of the product.  The headset is made of plastic and does not feel sturdy.- Style - Although I believe it looks good as an &#34;at-home&#34; headset.  If you want to wear this ouside the house, and you are older than 10 years old, you may as well wear a &#34;kick me&#34; sign.- Not ready for prime time as a audio (non gaming) headset.  Although some people states that these can compete with other purely audio headsets, and sony does include the wiring to enable you to do this, the sound quality on Audio files is not quite up to par with proffession grade heasets.  Its good if you want to use for a PS Vita or other portable gaming system but only adequate for music.- Charging cord is Extremely short, depending on how you have your system set up this could be a concern if you don't have other cables to use.Overall, I am please with the headphones and they perform as I anticipated.  One major feature that I have yet to test is VOIP.  I've seen mixed reivews from other people as to how well they are heard and/or how they hear people.  .  I may try to test this out this weekend, however most of my multiplayer friends are on Live and not PSN.  I will update review if necesssary once I can evaluate voice.  The reason I included XBOX one in title is because this appears to be even better than the announced stereo only Microsoft headphones.  You can use it with that sytem if you need to but will still have to get their adapter for any headphone (that can be debated on review of its own item).  For me if I have to get the adapter I can use my old Turtle Beach Headphones which I find superior to either one.\n",
      "29947843: Better than pulse These are by far the best headset i have ever used. They are better than beats in my opinion. Sound quality is fantastic\n",
      "39736583: Very good sound quality! I have used this headset on my ps4 and on my PC. Works great on both systems with great sound.When it's connected to the PS4 wirelessly, you get the crisp sound of 7.1 virtual surround sound. There is also a button on the left ear cup to turn it off. ( but who would want to do that?)You can also connect the headset to the ps4 using the 3.5mm connector. This allows you to use the headset without using the battery on the headset. But, if you use this method, you will not get the 7.1 virtual surround sound. Either way has great sound. But the wireless method is a little better.You can also adjust the sound / chat ratio on the headset as well. By adjusting the chat sound higher, the game sound will lower. ( Think of it as a teeter-totter. )If your looking for a good gaming headset for your Ps4, but don't want to spend a ton on the other brands, buy these. They are very good for the price.\n",
      "33671932: Great headset! I bought this headset because I have a turtle beach that is not wireless. I love the headset and the sound is great! Goodbye turtlebeach!\n",
      "17419182: Pretty decent for the price So I purchased these headphones recently (not on Amazon unfortunately since they weren't available yet) and overall I like them.  They are very light considering the size.  The ear cups are large and fit over my ears well and don't cause any discomfort, which is nice.  It is a little uncomfortable to wear glasses with them, but not so bad that it can't be over come.  The sound is pretty decent, with 2 select-able settings, one pretty basic and the other with more bass.  You can also get a companion app on the PS4 which will allow for custom audio mixes in the future (i believe Infamous: Second Son will be the 1st title to support it).  One thing to note is that if you're not going to be using the built in microphone for in game chat, then it's a good idea to mute it.  There is a button on the left side that easily does this.  If you do not mute it, then the microphone is active and picks up ambient sounds in the room, and gives the audio and &#34;airy&#34; sound.  Once muted though it sounds fine.  They fold up pretty small for there size i suppose, and come with a soft carry bag if you need it.  The headphones also come with a 8mm cable so you can use them with any device that has that type of jack (phone, mp3, portable game system, etc...).  The headphones do have to pair with an included dongle, which works fine.  It automatically connects once the headphones are turned on.  So far the battery life seems fine.  I've only had to charge them once on the initial un-boxing.  Overall I like them, and they will serve their intended purpose.  My surround sound system still sounds better overall though, but then I would hope so.\n",
      "46418398: You can't expect more for the Price! I bought these yesterday and I come from Astro A40's. The setup is a piece of cake and they are super comfortable. For the sound, I read certain reviews complaining about the max volume. Take this into consideration, Battlefield 4 playing at max volume, you stand near a tank or heavy gun fire and your ears will want to explode of how loud and clear the sound is.Guys, for $100 you get wireless, easy setup, great construction quality, 7.1 surround, custom profiles in the future, think about it. What more can you expect for $100. The other headsets in comparison and 2 to 3 times the price.If you want something that is good and works and don't want to blow 300, trust me and just buy this. Other reviews that complain about certain things, obviously are not considering the price point and are comparing to headsets that are double and triple the price.\n",
      "36065092: I Was So Excited, but ended up dissappointed Let me preface this by saying I have owned every major console since NES and Genesis.Longtime Sony supporter too.I looked up everything I could find out about these and it seemed like a great headset to use on PSN in party chat gaming sessions.I was so excited about these I rushed to buy them cause I didn't want to wait for Amazon to restock.I must say I was thoroughly underwhelmed.My feelings are pretty much in line with the other 3 and 2 star reviews.Pretty good build, nice design, super comfortable. Which was a big reason I was excited for this product. I can't stress enough how much I like the build and how comfortable they are. But this is where the live affair endedPeople on party chat can hear you clearly but say I sound like IM \\\\\"in a box\\\\\" exactly like others stated in other reviews.They don't complain, and can hear me clearly. But it's a slight muffled sound that is ,\\\\\"just different\\\\\"The sound when playing a game like Battlefield 4 gives you more awareness to footsteps a slight more pop to gunfire, but it's really not spectacular. I thought maybe this would change when I set game volume to priority thus muting party chat. And while it's functional, it definitely isn't the same \\\\\"great\\\\\" quality others.are swearing by in positive reviews across.the net.The biggest thing that bothered me as someone who games alot in party chat, was the complete lack of depth in the GAME/CHAT priority slider.There never seemed to be that \\\\\"sweet spot\\\\\" where I can hear my party well and still feel like IM taking advantage of headset sound over my TV speakers.I have en ear for good audio, but would not consider myself a audiophile snob by any means.I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but I was expecting a good bang for my buck.I bought these as a gaming headset on PS4 and nothing else, so I wouldn't say my expectations were too high. I just wanted good , rich sound with some depth while I played in party chat.The balance in GAME/PARTY chat didn't give me that. And even at full volume it's definitely functional , but the Max volume was shockingly low, even if I don't expect top tier sound depth, I expect a 100 dollar headset at max volume to make me say, wow that's loud.Again not the case.If you ABSOLUTELY have to have a wireless headset for PS4 gaming, then it's not a bad product.I just didn't feel  the price met the hype. Which is a shame cause I was legitimately excited to get my hands on these at first.All I have to say really. I returned mine and suggest saving 250 or more if you want a social gaming headset with found that would make anyone impressed.\n",
      "44363760: Great Fit, Great Sound I have sensitive ears and cannot wear most headphones for very long, but these are great. They are light and fit nicely around the ear. Bottom line: These are the best wireless headphones I've used so far.\n",
      "5287080: TL;DR - Returned my Elites, kept Golds. Got my Golds earlier today, and I couldn't wait to test them out. They're great! I had ordered the Elites about a week ago, and literally days after they arrived, I found out about the Golds being released. Just my luck :P I basically had the choice of keeping my Elites, or returning them and keeping the Golds. I really liked the Elites but here were my major complaints: 1) horrible battery life (about 3 hours; I was constantly charging) and 2) very heavy with little padding (hurt my head after a while). The Golds definitely improve on both.The biggest thing people seem to be debating is whether or not bass impact will be on the Golds. They didn't totally add Bass Impact. On the Elites, Bass Impact was a boost in bass levels, plus they had nodes on either side of the head that would rumble/vibrate to correlate with on-screen action - basically like how the dualshock controllers rumble during explosions, gunfire, etc. I personally wasn't a fan of Bass Impact (neither the bass boost nor the rumble effect), so this wasn't make-or-break for me, but a ton of people like it. If you liked it, just know that the rumble is gone, but the bass boost remains.Here are features on the ear cups: Volume Up/Down, Virtual Surround Sound On/Off, Microphone, Microphone Mute On/Off, Audio Jack, Audio Modes, Chat Volume Up/Down. It also says the faceplates are customizable, but I have no idea how it works. Also, no sliders; I personally didn't mind the sliders, but everything is an on/off button now, except audio and chat volume, which are up/down buttons.PROS:- Bass boost is available (kind of like Bass Impact from Elites, but without the rumble).- WAY better battery than Elites (I've been using them all day, and I haven't had to charge yet).- Comes with charger.- Very light, and has plush padding on the headband.- Collapsible; ear cups fold in.CONS:- Charging cord is only 4 to 5 inches long, so you won't be able to charge and play at the same time. I found myself doing that all the time with the Elites, but that was because the battery was always dying on me. Can't tell yet if this will be an issue with the Golds.- You can only have one audio mode attached to the headphones at a single time; bass boost is considered an audio mode, so you can't have this turned on alongside another mode.- Seems easily breakable. They're very light, but that's because they're made out of what seems to be plastic. They feel a tad flimsy.Overall, I'm very happy with the upgrade! If you have the Elites, and are looking to upgrade, I'd say it depends on what matters to you. Audio quality is the same, features are almost the same. The only real difference are aesthetics, battery life, and whether or not Bass Impact matters to you. I upgraded because the Golds came out during the return period of my Elites, but I can't say whether or not I would have bought the Golds if I couldn't have returned the Elites.\n",
      "40108387: They Look sexy, and the speakers make sound 2/15/2014 UPDATE:I have been using these with GTA V, and to beat The Last of US. When it comes down to it, these were really enjoyable to use with gaming. so i am bringing up the star to an overall 3/5 (i wish i could do 3.5). for the sole purpose of gaming these work just like they should. just dont expect them to sound like a pair of good headphones with music.I would bring them up more, but even for gaming, they could still have more bass. And a better app to go back and forth with the settings to tell the difference between \\\\\"hip hop\\\\\", \\\\\"shooter\\\\\", \\\\\"custom\\\\\", etc when selecting sound modes.I see many people are not finding my review helpful, i would appreciate a comment on why since i really do want to give the best review i can.Quick Review: only buy for gaming (as a last resort, as in PS4 doesnt allow BT headsets anymore), music sounds bad, movies are ok. chat is good. They look good. i would say they are worth it at $50, but i dont think they are worth $100.Long Review:my audio background (i am not an audiophile):For the record i have never used headphones, stereo or virtual, for gaming; i was always a 5.1 surround sound system kinda guy for my computers and TV. Though, in my current living situation setting up my 5.1 system in my bedroom would be very cramped. I have had MANY headphones. from munitio mw3 series, sony ear buds, stock samsung earbuds, to bose in ear, QC2, QC3 and Bose OE (use to work for them). plus bluetooth headsets from Plantronics and jaybirds.But i wanted to try these for a more immersed experience and chat purposes. a lot of peoples ps3 headsets let in WAY TOO MUCH background noise. i wish everyone had a good headset. I Also thought having the headset would blow my flat screen tv speakers our of the water, but sadly they do not.Packaging 5/5:The headphones come in a hard cardboard package that is slipped into a out THIN package which has all the pictures. The internal hard cardboard is also blue and inside that is a cardboard insert that the headphones rest in (headphones are wrapped in plastic sheath). so don't be discouraged if the outer package looks dinged. All the extra contents are in a box under the headphones, and all extras as individually wrappedStyle 5/5:These headphones do look pretty stylish, but really this is a personal preference. Whether you like the style or not, what was done was done well. They did a great job on making sure these didn't look cheap.comfort 5/5:They look big, which might make you think they are heavy, but they are actually very light. They also are not very tight, in a good way, should be able to wear for long periods of time. From the image i though they might press my ears down too much, but there is good space between the ear and the cushion. (i have small ears that stick out)Build Quality 3.5/5:This is something that only time will tell. Though, right from the first feel i can tell you wouldn't want to accidentally step on them or treat them too ruff. They almost feel like a toy quality wise, if you are responsible you should be ok.Sound Quality 1.5/5 (from any 3.5mm audio source):First thing i did when i got them was plug in the cable, connect it to my cell and turn on Pandora. Right away i could tell that they sounded empty, like cheap ear buds placed in a big headphone (no bass). Its like their Passive mode is light and missing depth, will they make a sound? yes. will you enjoy that sound? not if you have ever owned any other headphones. there was even light static at low volume. all other headsets i listed above are DRASTICALLY BETTER.I tried the bass off, 1 and 2 selections but could not hear a change in the sound, i also couldn't hear a difference when i pressed the VSS (virtual surround sound) button or changed the volume using the headphone controls. This leads me to believe that those features may be disabled in regular \\\\\"passive\\\\\" headphone mode.I tested them with Pandora on my cell, youtube on my computer, and movies on my computer.Sound Quality 2.5/5 (HD video files stored on PS3):I have Avatar 3D stored on my PS3, they did do better with that, though they are still dont stack up to any other headphone i have ever owned. The VSS takes depth out of 80% of the audio, i guess this is sonys way of making it sound like a surround sound, by making it faint and empty as if its further away.the most enjoyable way to watch the movie was to have VSS off, and set it to 2 (1 is low bass and 2 is more bass). this was the fullest sound, but was stereo and still sounded very monotone (no highs or lows). not too much separation from missiles firing to voice to \\\\\"surround\\\\\" effects.Sound Quality 4.698/5 (Gaming):GTA V - I tested shooting all the guns, from machine, to grenade launchers. I think they were good (not great or amazing) for gaming with VSS on or off.VSS still takes away the fullness so you wont have much bass. again, i only liked the (2) setting. i was missing the bass from the cars exhaust and the full sound of vehicles explodingGhosts on the PS4 was good as well. but again, don't expect full deep sound. The VSS can be a little confusing since you will hear foot steps everywhere, but it wont actually allow you to pin point from where. i toggled VSS on and off, more spacious with it on, but less bass. its more flat with it off but fuller deeper sound.i didnt test the chat feature vigorously but some people playing ghosts said i sounded clear. (a youtube video compared it to some kraken 7.1 headsets and the pulse elite. the kraken had crystal clear voice chat and both sony units sounded like a bad cell phone call.Conclusion:All in All, i am a bit disappointed. Still has a dongle in this day and age, they could have built that tech into the PS4. Audio quality is bad when compared to normal headphones/earbuds. If you dont have a headset and you NEED a head set for the PS4 (because you cant use your tv speakers) and you will only use them for gaming, then i would say they are a maybe. (PS3 has more options that are most likely better).DO NOT buy them for ant other purpose then gaming. I will keep mine for a week or so to keep testing, though at this point i think i will return them. I wanted better sound then my tv speakers and clear voice chat. these don't accomplish exactly what i wanted.SONY - ALLOW ANY BT HEADSET ON THE PS4. IF YOUR GOING TO LOCK DOWN A SYSTEM (in terms of BT headsets), DON'T OFFER JUST 1 OPTION THAT IS BARELY WORTH HALF OF THE PRICE YOU ARE SELLING IT AT.helpfull doc for other compatible headsets:[...]Also, i dont want people to think i am a Sony hater. I think there TV's, along with high end Samsungs, are the best. I currently have the 55hx800, its 2 years old now, but looks better then 90% of the tv's sold today.I have also owned/own: PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PSP 1000, Viao Laptops and computer monitors (old school trinitron). i tend to buy every gaming accessory as well; eye toy, move, chat pad for ps3, etc.\n",
      "23597084: Wanted to love them...but just can't I'm writing this review coming from a TB DX12 headset so I have some comparison.  I LOVE the DX12s but the cords strung across the floor are a bummer sometimes.  The sound quality is awesome on the DX12 and I was \\\\\"hoping\\\\\" it would be at least similar on the Sony Gold set...unfortunately I was wrong.    First impressions out of the box....  - Very cool  - Love the look  - Light weight  - Buttons easily accessible while playing  - Seems well built    They very quickly charged in under 3 hours and I very excitedly took them downstairs to connect them up.  Setup was super easy...plug in USB dongle and switch on power.  This is where the excitement ended for me.  I fired up BF4 and started up a game.  The first thing I said to myself was \\\\\"man these sound like S***\\\\\".  VSS on/off didn't matter.  Power standard/bass boost didn't matter.  It just simply sounded like crap.  Tinny sounding gun fire, empty explosions, just not good.  The VSS was indeed at least working because I could easily pick out where the sounds were coming from.  The other thing that wasn't good was VOIP.  I always play with the same friend online and we both have the DX12 set.  When we talk it normally sounds similar to what it would sound like if you were simply on the phone with each other.  Clear talk, no problems.  Well with the Sony set I could hear him fine and he could \\\\\"technically\\\\\" hear me fine but he said it sounded like I was in a box.  Just wasn't nearly as good as my DX12s.  Not too terribly happy so far.  Well here's where it got worse for me.  I was able to forgive most of my other complaints simply because I liked the feel and the fact that I didn't have cords hanging all over the place.  BUT...for the 1st 30 minutes or so I was leaning forward on my couch playing about 6 feet from the console/TV and all was fine.  I then moved back to get more comfortable to a distance of maybe 8-9 feet and the sound started cutting out and I lost connection to the USB dongle.  I moved back to my originalposition and it reconnected and worked fine again.  Tested one more time moving to the 8-9 feet distance and same thing...sound cut out and lost connection.  THIS BY ITSELF was a HUGE red flag and the single reason they will be going back for a refund.  I was willing to work around all the other little complaints with these but if I can't get more than 8 feet away before losing connection then it's just not happening.    Sorry Sony - I wanted to love them...but I just can't    So the Pros and Cons list in case you didn't want to read all the crap above...    Pros  - Well built  - Comfortable  - Quickly charges  - Easy Easy Easy setup  - WIRELESS!    Cons  - SUB PAR AUDIO (When I play a game like BF4 I expect to be submersed in the game and feel like I'm really there. Unfortunately these made me feel like I was watching from the sidelines)  - VOIP (Friends said, although they could clearly hear my voice in game, it sounded like I was in \\\\\"a box\\\\\")  - Volume just wasn't quite enough (I had to have the volume maxed out, otherwise it just felt like it wasn't quite enough)  - Unacceptable range (Outside of 8 feet, I was constantly losing the connection to the PS4)\n"
